Martin> We've received a distress call from the Ohniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack.
Ward> I have no questions, your honor.
Ward> How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you?
Alan> That course will take us very close to the Neutral Zone, Captain.
Alan> Commander Shelby, you will lead the away team.
Ward> So much for the transporter.
Martin> We have nothing to compare it to, but it's microscopic... seems colonial... simple... and inorganic.  That's why the recon scouts missed it. This one wasn't your mistake.
Ward> That's... an understatement... I can't even...
Martin> Slow to impulse speed.
Ward> I think we can give the captain a new bargaining chip. Doctor Crusher, flood the cargo bay with your containment field...
Ward> It's a long story, Captain...  ... but I'm sure it doesn't have anything to do with this accident.
Alan> Corrosion then.
Alan> What I wanted? You probed the Enterprise... lured us here... so you could play games with me. I didn't want any of that... you did. Why?
Martin> You've saved people before. You can save her.
Ward> Staff's waiting if Doctor Crusher approves.
Martin> ... and that you might have thought it was a line.
Alan> I have to ask you about your husband.
Alan> I understand she's been ill... and she's very old -- probably senile.  Listen... we might all end up like that some day.
Martin> I agree with you... it's not worth playing this game.
Alan> Then what would make him change his mind? Why would he leave the ship now?
Alan> She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have been fugitives for years. I suspect he's pretty good at evading capture. As cold as it sounds we're going to have to treat this mission as if it never happened. Everything will remain exactly as it was before we arrived.
Martin> This is not a Klingon ship, sir.
Alan> I understand she's been ill... and she's very old -- probably senile.  Listen... we might all end up like that some day.
Alan> At ease, Lieutenant!
Martin> We don't have that much time.
Martin> And this is Lieutenant Worf.  Something wrong, Lieutenant?
Martin> Sensors picking up any signs of life?
Martin> Not these dreams.
Ward> What about the lateral sensors?
Alan> Mister Data, I gave you a direct order. Release the Transporter lock-out. Now.
Martin> I'm initiating computer task hand-off...
Ward> Who reported to the bridge from this group?
Ward> It's a charity hospital near the waterfront.
Alan> ... are the phaser drilling sites.
Martin> It's going to be all right... everything's going to be fine...
Martin> I will tell my captain to expect your grievance.
Alan> Obey my orders.
Alan> I've guided his training; I'm the one at fault, sir.  You will show proper courtesy, and I'm taking you down there to make certain of it!  With your approval, of course, sir.
Alan> Captain, let's try it.
Ward> Clear that cargo. Beam it to a hold.
Alan> Yes, but I've had it. Let's put all this technology and computers to work -- figure out what's going on -- and get the hell out of here.
Alan> Sorry, Doctor, you heard the Captain. Duty calls.
Ward> Shields up.
Ward> Ladies and Gentlemen... Night Bird.
Alan> Yes, the shuttle must have been just out of range.
Ward> What if I snore in my sleep?
Martin> Maybe your own feelings are getting in the way --
Martin> Yes.  He's beautiful, Deanna... just like his mother.  I don't think you are going to be needed here, Lieutenant.
Martin> Yes, Data, it was.
Alan> Just that he's an interesting man.
Alan> When I was your age... my own father... he wasn't there for me. And I needed him. I really... needed him.  I always wondered what kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. Maybe the idea even scared me a little.
Ward> I was in a hospital... then on the Enterprise... and the hospital again...  I kept shifting back and forth... I couldn't tell what was real...
Ward> Was it so obvious...
Alan> That's one option...
Ward> The Klingons are very thorough, Captain. I'm sure Commander Kurn has studied for his assignment with us just as I studied to serve with them.
Martin> I had Worf check the weapons locker on the relay station... there's a phaser missing.
Alan> What woman would have him? With an ego like his --
Martin> That's one trick I didn't even know about...
Ward> If we lose anti-matter containment...
Martin> I'll be there.
Ward> Standard evasive maneuver.
Alan> A Dyson Sphere?
Ward> I'm just your average everyday human who happens to be a commander. Now what are your orders?
Ward> We'll return to the Enterprise and consider your proposal.
Ward> I've met someone... someone who's becoming important to me...
Ward> I think you should pursue it. First of all, she's a beautiful woman who seems to be crazy about you.
Martin> Where is Captain Picard? What have you done with Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data?
Martin> Sir, with all due respect... we've run into one dead end... and it doesn't sound like Indri Eight is any more promising. We're already late for the conference on Atalia Seven...
Ward> Sir, you can't believe they'd relieve you from command...
Ward> If there's nothing else, we'll be on our way...
Ward> I knew who I was a second ago... I was on the ship... in a play...  It's getting harder to remember...
Ward> Begin firing sequence countdown from twenty-four.
Ward> No, just my cards...
Ward> Reflection Therapy?
Martin> But at least they knew their enemy better than we do. Maybe they even knew how they got into trouble... they just didn't know how to get out.
Alan> How many?
Ward> Get away from her.
Ward> I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mister Data, prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord.
Alan> Is everybody all right?
Alan> Why the devil would we be going there? Are there any miners or indigenous life forms on the planet?
Ward> What changed your mind?
Ward> Take my hand --
Alan> Lieutenant?
Ward> I know that...
Ward> That's a direct order, Mister Data.
Ward> Captain, I recommend we transfer all power to phasers, and arm the photon torpedos.
Ward> Do you really think Endar would go along with that?
Martin> Through there. Glass of wine while I cook?
Ward> Why?
Martin> Nelvana Three on screen.
Ward> I would like to make one suggestion, sir.
Martin> We mean you no harm. We have an injured crew in that shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass?
Martin> How could that be? The Professor's data depends on --
Alan> Is it my imagination, or have tempers aboard this ship been getting a little frayed lately?
Alan> Deanna, what -- ?
Alan> In the interest of diplomatic relations, I'll remain with Mistress Beata while you conduct your search.
Ward> Lieutenant?
Martin> Doctor, if you're prepared to get started, so are we...
Ward> I'm sorry.
Martin> You're not going anywhere.
Alan> I wonder, Captain. Ordinarily, I don't believe in distrust at first sight... but this may be an exception.
Ward> Regulations call for a Yellow Alert.
Alan> Take it easy, Wes. We'll find him. I want to begin a methodical search. Sensors on maximum scan We'll use our present location as the center. Data plot a search pattern from our present coordinates which will cover the most area in the shortest time.
Ward> May I escort you in, Miss Troi...
Ward> Let's get out of here.
Alan> Why can't we go around it?
Ward> Who the hell are these people? There's got to be some way to get through to them.
Martin> Good evening.
Alan> No, I can't. You're right. Because I've seen the part of you that regrets what you have become... Yuta, listen to me... you don't have to do this any more.
Alan> And Hickman?
Ward> It's moving, sir.
Martin> Set course to intercept.
Martin> Anything you want to talk about, Geordi?
Alan> Aye, sir.
Alan> Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep, Mister Data.
Alan> Great!
Martin> Well, how was racquetball?
Alan> I knew he'd have a great time.
Martin> That means it doesn't have much range.
Alan> Well... we'll see.
Martin> Captain, are we delaying our rendezvous with the Hood?
Martin> The fact it is traveling at its present velocity suggests an answer.
Alan> The Romulans.
Ward> It's very beautiful. I'll arrange for you to see it, if you like.
Alan> ... actually, it's somewhere between venison -- musk ox -- and Kobe beef.
Ward> Fate protects fools, little children and ships called Enterprise.  Lock phasers on the Romulan, but hold your fire.
Martin> Captain -- this is incredible. I have just entered what appears to be the nursery.
Alan> Even you aren't that cruel.
Martin> Bridge.
Martin> But you don't know that the exocomps are life forms...
Martin> Mister Data, you'll coordinate the evacuation of the colonists.  Doctor, they have nine patients in the outpost infirmary. Your priority will be getting them to Sickbay -- after that you'll stay aboard the Enterprise and be ready to receive casualties.  Marquez, you'll take some people down to track the storm -- you'll need to keep all teams apprised of its heading.  Commander, you'll coordinate the deployment of the deflectors.
Martin> Commander, we don't have to like each other to work well together. In fact, I expect you to continue to keep me on my toes.
Ward> You're certain about the atmospheric conditions, Data... ?
Alan> All I have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someone taking a shower in his or her clothing.
Ward> I admit we restrict advanced technology to all...
Alan> Affirmative. Enterprise out.
Alan> What about the transporter logs?
Alan> Us?
Alan> Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
Martin> It's worth a try.
Martin> The captain.
Ward> Security, all decks... yellow alert... possible intruder...
Martin> Admiral, may I present Captain Picard.
Ward> First of all, android or not, I won't allow anyone to take that kind of risk. Second, if the computer isn't working in engineering, I'm going to need your help to get control of the ship.
Martin> He believes what he says. And there is no trace imprint for Doctor Quaice.
Alan> Sure, why not.
Ward> Gul Lemec has arrived. He's waiting for you in the Observation Lounge.
Martin> There's time now... I'm going back to the nineteenth century for the Captain.  Doctor... ?
Alan> Perhaps.
Alan> I think I'll go give her some help, Captain.
Alan> I'm sure.
Martin> At least it's better than standing by helplessly and dying.
Alan> Help is all they're going to get. They certainly can't force anything upon us, can they?
Martin> Really?
Ward> Barclay?
Alan> Speed being the obvious one. This ship literally thinks what it wants to do and it happens.
Ward> You claim to be an advanced society, yet you resort to tyranny and executions in order to suppress those who don't share your views.
Alan> It's not real...
Martin> Computer... location of Doctor Beverly Crusher.
Alan> Thank you. Now the first thing I think we should discuss is this...
Ward> You hate them as much as they hate you.
Alan> Even you aren't that cruel.
Ward> Yes, but we need our chief engineer back on board our ship--
Alan> I've been in every room. There's nothing unusual about this house except that it's here. What about them?
Alan> Thank you, Lieutenant. Captain?
Alan> This is primarily a necessary diplomatic mission. The Jaradan are strategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts failed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in the pronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty-year rift in the relation.
Martin> What's wrong?
Martin> Go to impulse. Back us off.
Ward> Tell them no.
Alan> A complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes turned up no surprises. No sign of life, nothing out of the ordinary.
Alan> We'll try and keep you so busy you won't have time to.  I'd better be going; I have to get back to the Cargo Bay.
Martin> And that?
Alan> You were there, in the cavern. You know what happened. What am I supposed to do?
Ward> "You control every move... tell me what to eat, what to think, what to say... "
Ward> You're gonna make us search through this to find him?
Alan> If he's under an alien influence, doesn't that put us all at risk?
Alan> I'm sorry. Can we take it from "You're becoming agitated"?
Ward> I take it the captain was able to negotiate an agreement mutually beneficial to both parties.
Martin> Ensign Keller, can you hear me?
Ward> Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, your first officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will step outside and Lieutenant Lewis will assign you to crew quarters.  Ensign, you are here on the exchange program, you'll follow Mister Crusher.
Alan> Kazago, I ask again, first officer to first officer... what is going on? Something is happening that neither of us seems to know about.
Ward> Including the Neutral Zone border?
Ward> Lieutenant.
Ward> And we'll be experiencing actual battle conditions?
Alan> NOW!
Martin> We could return him to the crash site... but we'd have to erase his memories of being on the Enterprise.
Martin> What's wrong?
Martin> We don't have any choice. We have to try.
Alan> Yes. All of them.
Alan> One thousand, fourteen.
Ward> I was sure they would. They are reasonable people... just trapped in their own anger.
Alan> Then it could be a distress call.
Ward> I know that... but -- you can't make someone... love you.
Alan> What's all this?
Ward> Wallace and Towles.
Martin> Give us a superior curve, Mister Crusher.
Martin> Execute.  Let's go to Yellow Alert.
Ward> What's happening, Mister Worf?
Ward> Could the same treatment work for us?
Martin> What is it?
Ward> There's no time to debate the issues, Ramsey. We're taking you with us whether you choose to go or not.
Alan> Yes, we're from a ship called the Enterprise. We monitored your distress call but you never acknowledged our response.
Alan> Spread out... twenty five meter radius... our window back closes in nine minutes...
Martin> With all due respect, sir... I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost people on missions before.  Carmen was a good friend. But that's not why I'm saying this.
Martin> No! Wesley, I may know best of all.  Our friendship, our long talks...
Ward> Worf?  What the hell are you doing?
Martin> I am Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
Ward> In my opinion, we have no choice, sir.
Ward> On second thought, Trent, we would be honored to watch your moral imperative in action.
Martin> Doctor...
Martin> Not now, Remmick... Captain, he's going to take her out.
Martin> Engage, Mister Crusher.
Martin> Since we don't know the condition of the shuttle crew, I'll beam us all directly to sickbay.
Martin> Engage!
Martin> Which leaves me right back where I started.
Ward> And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a "treatment."
Martin> That'll reach almost everyone. Send out medical teams to treat the rest.
Alan> Thank you sir.
Ward> Data. Are you sitting on a full house or a flush?
Ward> At least twenty, maybe twenty-five minutes.
Alan> There aren't any structures down here. They could've gone anywhere, Captain.
Alan> If you want to discuss anything about Captain Picard, bring him in here and ask him face to face.
Martin> "... still had the feeling that you wanted to stay... start to go... change your mind... "
Alan> Any luck?
Alan> We believe that everything in the Universe has a right to exist.
Alan> Fencing, sir? I'm really not very good.
Ward> Aye, sir.
Alan> Captain! Are you all right?
Martin> Data? Data!
Alan> Deck fifteen. Only a few decks below the shuttlebay.
Alan> I can't just leave her there. They'll give her these psychotectic treatments...  I don't know what to do.
Alan> What's their heading, Mister Worf... ?
Martin> All decks are to begin radiation protocol.
Alan> My broken arm...
Alan> As soon as I heard this Barolian ship was at Galorndon Core, I started to think Romulans...
Ward> Any hostile move on our part would only jeopardize Geordi.
Ward> You're lying, Setal.
Martin> Admiral, Deanna... I need a moment with you...  ... Commander Data, if you will, please accompany the Ambassador on his... tour.
Martin> Doctor?
Ward> It's just that our mental pathways have... become accustomed to your... sensory input patterns...
Alan> Isn't it? Data may be the issue, but our performances are what will be judged.
Alan> Dismissed.
Ward> Captain!
Alan> I do.
Alan> Kalin Trose, you may confer with your people. But we must have your answer within eight hours.
Martin> Slow to impulse.
Alan> What Federation starship was closest to Khitomer at the time of the attack?
Alan> Unbelievable.
Ward> Who? You can't mean Doctor Noonien Soong?
Martin> I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.
Ward> That's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made of sugar and spice. Boys are made of snips and snails...
Ward> It's Paul Rice from the Drake.
Ward> We're from a Federation starship. We've answered your distress call. Your ship is in good hands, but we need to get you to our Sickbay.
Alan> Then I'll learn to fly. You are the heart in my day and the soul in my night.
Alan> Come in.
Martin> Data is a physical representation of a dream, an idea conceived of by the mind of a man. His purpose? To serve human needs and interests. He is a collection of neural nets and heuristic algorithms. His responses are dictated by an elaborate software program written by a man. The hardware  was built by a man.
Alan> Superior?
Martin> Still arguing the human past? Perhaps you're not that original.
Alan> That may be dangerous.
Alan> I can't see anything from here. The underbrush is very thick.
Alan> But you're so sure it'll "talk" to you.
Alan> I'm sure we can arrange for you to have more off-duty time while they're here.
Martin> Yes.
Martin> Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship...
Ward> We can't give the aliens any more time...
Alan> Captain! The engines can't take this strain.
Ward> What do you mean?
Alan> Shut that thing down!
Alan> Do it.
Martin> You're welcome.
Martin> Maybe an atmospheric disturbance...
Ward> Apparently, Deanna's being aboard was only part of the reason.
Ward> Their last message said they were attempting to crash land on one of the planets in the Mericor system. We should arrive in just under seven hours.
Martin> We can't just sit here.
Ward> Data, are you picking up anything?
Martin> The hotel gets bought? By whom?
Alan> I guess it's been a while since you had to punch a clock.
Alan> Okay, don't listen. Forget that I beat you in thirty moves...
Martin> Do you need help?
Alan> Source?
Ward> I think so. I have been preparing.
Ward> On my way.
Ward> We're glad you're here.
Martin> In what sense? It sounds like he put you through hell.
Alan> Our friend is back.
Martin> That's one trick I didn't even know about...
Ward> It's our poker night, Admiral. There's always an open seat for you...
Alan> Riker to Enterprise... Riker to Enterprise...
Alan> No... but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation...
Alan> Fire.
Alan> Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship...
Ward> Mister Worf, Red Alert.
Alan> Another time. It's too close to our real contest.
Ward> What about the doors, the ones we came in? If they stay open, would the system short out? Heat of that magnitude requires a seal of some sort, doesn't it?
Martin> Looks like the poor devil died in its sleep.
Alan> On the way.
Ward> I understand that. But we've got other departments waiting to use the array.
Ward> Aye sir.
Martin> Perhaps they are running out of people to kill. In any case, for whatever reason -- peace is now preferred. That should make your job easier.
Ward> We have no wish to inconvenience you. We've arranged for quarters on the planet...
Alan> Set phasers on stun.
Martin> I understand... but whoever I seem to be... I am Odan... the man who loved you... and that has not changed. I still love you. I can't help that.
Alan> Mister Data?
Ward> Young Mister Crusher started it. I'm afraid it's caught on.
Martin> Mind if I ask what that is?
Martin> Aye, sir.  Reverse our direction and set a course for the Cornelian star system. Warp two.
Ward> It wasn't. There was the computer time lag, for one thing.
Alan> Set up a translink to their computer core. Let's see what happened.
Martin> Orton could be improvising... maybe he didn't plan to take us hostage this early... so now he doesn't know what to do...
Martin> Well, Data... it's just... I mean, will you be all right?
Ward> Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems?
Ward> Great.
Martin> Everything's gonna be okay...
Alan> Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship...
Ward> Did you know him, Captain?
Martin> Go take a look, fast!
Alan> On screen.
Ward> But they want us to know they're there.
Alan> Doctor, we've located the soliton wave. It's still on course for Lemma Two... but its velocity has increased to warp four point one.
Ward> Kahlest... who was she?
Martin> Hold fire. Lieutenant La Forge is on that ship.
Alan> To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc.
Alan> I feel... terrible. But thanks to you, I'm much better now. And I feel confident that when I leave, I'll be ready to take my place in society again.
Alan> Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts.
Martin> I suppose the warp coil. Before we had warp drive, Humans were confined to a single sector of the galaxy.
Alan> Still arguing the human past? Perhaps you're not that original.
Alan> You're a dead man, Apgar. A dead man.
Martin> I'm sure my report will only underscore the need for continued support of your research.
Ward> Counselor, I'd like you with us on this one...
Martin> Or I, that women are. That's why I can be here with you while the women on the away team go to find Ramsey.
Ward> My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is how to obey my orders.  Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner over that of lieutenant?
Ward> Who was it?
Ward> We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We tracked two crewmen to this area. Do you know anything about them?
Ward> Run a maintenance sweep.
Martin> Deanna...
Martin> Commander La Forge wants to get an idea of how big this pocket is. He thinks the rate of energy absorption will be linked to its size.
Martin> Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher.
Martin> Yes.
Ward> They've cloaked themselves.
Alan> Ladies and Gentlemen... Night Bird.
Martin> "What to eat, what to think, what to say... "  "And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a 'treatment'... "
Ward> Maybe I did kill someone. I don't know. But I want to find out.
Ward> Soren...
Ward> Cause?
Martin> We've also got some volcanic activity... pretty severe.
Ward> Can you stabilize it?
Martin> In the Marta community on the southern continent...
Ward> Why haven't we heard anything about that?
Martin> Mister Worf, contact the mining settlement. Tell them we are joining the search for Captain Picard.  Ensign, set a new course. Warp nine.
Alan> Ensign Crusher, set a course that follows those currents...
Martin> A letter to his wife and daughter.
Martin> But you have no place to go?
Alan> It's not Tin Man I'm worried about. It's more Romulans showing up.
Alan> Is it big enough to be a threat?
Alan> You're welcome.
Alan> I'd say it's a risk we have to take.
Alan> We spent some time together. Not very well.
Ward> Are you sure they're safe?
Ward> Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be in holodeck four.
Alan> Then, you're convinced it is the Borg... ?
Alan> Maybe somebody's trying to tell us something.
Martin> Geordi... evacuate Engineering...
Ward> The rematerialization subroutine has been disabled.
Martin> I'll see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room.
Alan> Energize.
Ward> Wait, sir.  Open a hailing frequency.
Ward> Captain, the entire crew has been wiped out.
Martin> And what happens to the colony if she does? If others join her?
Alan> This creature that calls itself ARMUS is down on that planet waiting for us to come back. It wants us to come back. It killed Tasha. It could have just as easily killed us all. It didn't. Troi and Ben Prieto are still alive. For a reason. It wants something -- and it knows we will not leave so long as Troi and Ben are alive.
Alan> With pleasure, sir.
Martin> Right now, all we have are suspicions... not enough to act upon. The next move is his.
Alan> Good luck, Admiral.
Martin> They're going to put you out of a job, Geordi.
Ward> The image of Rice has been replaced by something which is hovering several meters away.
Martin> But it weakened him in some way, leading to the incredible jump out here.
Ward> Captain... it's time. We'd better go.
Alan> Miridian Six... near the Neutral Zone? I thought it was uninhabited...
Martin> Ah. And aren't pioneers, like you, adventurers at heart?
Ward> A complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes turned up no surprises. No sign of life, nothing out of the ordinary.
Ward> ... in all the Holodeck.
Martin> I'm not sure yet. There's some kind of a slick blocking our path. We'll keep you apprised.
Ward> We could use the tractor beam to focus the transporter.
Alan> Belay that.
Alan> Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker, First Officer.
Ward> The only way we can wind up in the same starfield is if you bring us out of warp speed at precisely the same instant as the Lantree.
Alan> Five to six weeks...
Alan> T'Pel?
Alan> Bridge, engage engines!
Martin> Yeah... I felt trapped by the console...  But it wasn't like this... there was something else here...
Ward> You're not Minuet.
Martin> I've heard better.
Martin> Arm photons, Mister Worf, and lock them on the center of the vortex.
Ward> Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave now.
Alan> So have you decided where you're going yet?
Alan> You didn't know?
Alan> Bridge, this is Commander Riker. We are taking the survivors to Sickbay.
Alan> Position.
Ward> Data.
Ward> Is that your card?
Alan> Well, we're all gonna have to depend on each other to get through this, okay?
Ward> Then steady on.
Alan> If the timetable is correct, we should get an indication of something very soon.
Martin> You're the key to all this, aren't you? Who are you?
Alan> Unverified -- the solar flares may have caused a malfunction in the biofilters --
Alan> You think this is funny?
Martin> It had an impact alright...
Ward> That's an order. Return to the ship when you're finished here. I'll signal for transport as soon as I can.
Alan> Come in.
Martin> Right now, I think you had better be in Shuttle Bay Two.
Martin> Again.
Alan> But this is not a time for change. I need you all where you are, where Captain Picard always relied on you.  I have been... reluctantly... forced to conclude that Commander Shelby, our expert on the Borg, is the ideal choice at this time for first officer.
Martin> This is too easy.
Ward> Engineering?
Alan> You're my friend... so it seemed like...  I'm not sure. It just seemed right to tell you.
Martin> With all the power that MacDuff had... to alter our brain chemistry, and manipulate the computers... it's hard to believe he needed the Enterprise.
Ward> Certainly!
Ward> "What to eat, what to think, what to say... "  "And when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a 'treatment'... "
Ward> You don't have to do that.
Martin> I'll be on the bridge, sir.
Martin> I'll need access to your logs, your files...  It won't take long. My people can do the work.
Martin> Maximum impulse velocity.
Alan> Uh, sure.
Alan> Intense storm activity over the southern pole is making it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace of the Essex...
Alan> Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields?
Ward> Well Mister Potts, why don't we start at the beginning?
Martin> A shield? What kind?
Ward> Explain.
Alan> And Worf, who wants nothing...
Ward> Someone's been here...
Martin> He cleared the Iconian program from his own system. How?
Alan> Alert all science labs to standby. They should be coordinating their efforts with Commander Data.
Martin> Yes, sir, I must report it to Starfleet. But at this distance, it will take at least a full day for subspace communications to reach there...
Ward> Mister Data. We've got a very sick boy on the Enterprise who's not getting any better. And we're dead in the water until you get us out of here.
Alan> To make us believe she died as a result of the 'malfunction.'
Alan> A small run-in with an aspiring sprinter.
Ward> Have you run a diagnostic on the sensors, Data?
Martin> I hooked it... but my father took the pole... wouldn't even let me reel it in... he said I might lose it.
Martin> "Chief engineer," that has a nice ring to it.
Alan> I don't know if it's still in the memory banks, but I used to have this great fishing program on the Holodeck...
Ward> ... Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence -- now!
Martin> There has to be.
Alan> It's not our place to interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies.
Martin> Commander Data, you have the bridge. Ensign Crusher, you will accompany me.
Ward> Doctor, for personal reasons, I'll walk.
Martin> Let's seal this entrance.
Ward> Status?
Martin> Geordi, you and Ro.
Martin> Who is it?
Alan> I'll see about getting main power back on-line.
Alan> My name is Will.
Alan> Stargazer! Respond, Captain!
Martin> There's a risk... we're not certain how stable the rift will be...
Alan> Yes... of course I do...
Alan> Of course I like... Oh... is there a technique to this foot washing?
Ward> We're in orbit around Bynaus.  How are they?
Martin> You don't sound very confident.
Alan> What were you looking for?
Ward> Right.
Alan> What was she doing?
Ward> It's not a question of harm. A single William Riker is unique, maybe even special. Hundreds or thousands of them diminish me in a way I can't explain.
Ward> You're going to call my bluff, aren't you?
Ward> I think we should go on the presumption that they've all been destroyed.
Ward> Some kind of probe. I'll bet that's what damaged the array.
Alan> Shields up, load all torpedo bays, stand-by phasers.
Ward> Good luck, sir.
Ward> Yes, Captain.
Alan> Bring the engines back on line, Mister La Forge... And restore all systems to normal.
Ward> I suppose the warp coil. Before we had warp drive, Humans were confined to a single sector of the galaxy.
Alan> Oh?
Ward> Toxic?
Ward> We would never mature into adults.
Martin> Yeah. The play is full of disturbing images. People losing their minds... being tortured by doctors...  I can't get it out of my head...
Alan> No extraterrestrial source has ever used this beacon?
Ward> The test ship's warp field is becoming unstable... sensors show multiple disruptions.
Alan> Where are the others?
Martin> First Officer's log, supplemental. I have no choice but to break the stalemate. If war is the result... Maybe it was inevitable. Perhaps the distance between our races is so vast that nothing else was ever possible...
Ward> You're also the food taster?
Ward> What happened?
Ward> That phaser's set to kill, Captain.
Martin> In what way?
Alan> Captain - I don't mean to break this up, but...
Alan> Aye, sir.  Request permission to begin planning a rescue operation.
Martin> Data. Interesting night?
Ward> And the other one -- his assistant?
Alan> I'd like to discuss some of our suggestions for regulating travel around the null space. Maybe we could have an early dinner... so you could still get your work done afterwards.
Martin> Inertial dampers are failing... hang on!
Alan> Okay, Morta. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processing cores cross linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat and fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The core elements are based on FTL nanoprocessor units arranged into twenty-five bilateral kelilactirals with twenty of those units being slaved to the central heisenfram terminal.  You do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is, don't you?
Martin> We've seen it before -- we know what it is. Now get moving!
Alan> What is it?
Martin> Right away.
Martin> Hold fast.  Data?
Ward> Why... here... or anywhere. We're not that structured.
Ward> Did you find them all, Geordi?
Alan> The Professor is scheduled to meet a Vulcan transport the day after tomorrow.
Ward> Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do it!
Alan> Main Shuttle Bay, prepare to receive shuttle.
Martin> The hell there isn't.
Martin> Lieutenant Yar -- Commander Data.
Alan> We're going back to the ship. Let me know as soon as you have something.
Ward> Maybe there's a way we can help ourselves remember more...
Ward> I can't imagine you leaving the Enterprise.
Ward> You mean, there's something even more remarkable about you?
Ward> Yes. Arrangements are being made to make his last days with us as comfortable as possible.
Alan> Maybe we should pick this up in the morning, Mister La Forge -- get a fresh start.  And would you do me a favor? Stop by my quarters at oh-seven hundred hours. I've been having trouble waking up.
Alan> We could leave the child here. If Data's right, it would have an ample supply of food.
Ward> Alright... but there's one thing I'd like to do first...
Martin> The phaser was set to level ten.  Standard procedure requires that all phasers are set to level one when they're in storage.
Alan> Alexander!
Martin> Why haven't we heard anything about that?
Ward> Listen, I really have to leave...
Alan> You're lying...
Martin> Have external sensors detected anything out of the ordinary?
Ward> Aye, sir.
Martin> I remember my early lessons.
Alan> I'd like extra decontamination precautions, Captain.
Ward> Great work, Doctor.
Ward> Gentlemen, if this is what you call "enhancement" you have a gift for understatement.
Martin> Primitive.
Ward> Where the hell is he?
Martin> How long to set that up?
Alan> To an Earth woman, I'd lie.  But you'd know it if I did.
Alan> Gaps? After what I've just seen, I find that hard to believe.
Martin> Three days?
Alan> These things happen.
Ward> But that's pure assumption. We still know virtually nothing about Manheim's work.
Martin> But that's toward Engineering.
Martin> The test ship's warp field is becoming unstable... sensors show multiple disruptions.
Martin> How long will that take?
Alan> Ever since he came aboard... I keep finding myself thinking about... the choices you and I made.
Alan> What about you?
Alan> But the three percent efficiency increase of the other vessels could still have been caused by other things such as simply working more carefully, better station coordination...
Alan> I'd call that geological instability.
Martin> The Jarada.
Alan> You're going to need this.
Martin> Slow to impulse speed.
Alan> I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advance navigation at the Academy presents the student with three options. When Rice took the test, he rejected all of them and offered one of his own.
Alan> Perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor network. Make sure we haven't overlooked anything.
Ward> Come in.
Alan> Aye, sir.
Alan> I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship is falling into a gravity well. It'll be destroyed within twenty-five minutes... Holodeck and all.
Martin> Inside... keep moving, deep into the cave...
Martin> This bug's persistent, I'll admit. But I'm not worried. We Rikers are ornery, too...
Alan> Data -- if we project our course past the rendezvous coordinates, what lies ahead?
Martin> Is this Iconia?
Martin> Sorry. I used the last of 'Owon eggs.
Alan> Spacecraft?
Alan> What kinds of "services?"
Martin> You're looking in the general direction of the constellation Pegasus.
Martin> And can this man ever argue.
Alan> Deanna...
Alan> I know that.
Alan> Captain Picard, this is the Enterprise, sir...
Ward> Realign for polar orbit.
Martin> The warp reactor core?
Ward> Mister Remmick has left the ship.
Alan> Hey, hold on, we've gotta coordinate our efforts here...
Martin> Recommendations.
Ward> I'm Commander Riker.
Martin> You're welcome.
Alan> Damn it.
Martin> No bother, Doctor Bernard.
Alan> It appears you've inherited someone else's problem... It's an old waste vessel... caught by your planet's gravitational pull.
Ward> Waiting for your signal, Captain.
Martin> I believe that's what the illusion is meant to be.
Ward> Yes. If you believe those accusations, you should act on them.
Ward> Well, I'd say the commander certainly has the crew on their toes...
Ward> Viewer.
Ward> Mister Data, I gave you a direct order. Release the Transporter lock-out. Now.
Ward> Eons! Have you any idea how far we'll advance?
Alan> How long do we have?
Alan> I'm going to explore the other floors; you two go down to the lobby, see if we've missed anything. Talk to the other "guests" -- try and find out who and what they are.
Martin> Why?
Martin> I don't know who any of you are.
Ward> Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, your first officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will step outside and Lieutenant Lewis will assign you to crew quarters.  Ensign, you are here on the exchange program, you'll follow Mister Crusher.
Alan> I remember it now... I was in an alley... they attacked me from behind. I tried to defend myself with the nisroh knife Worf gave me...  I managed to fight off one of them... but I think they injected me with some kind of drug...
Ward> We were having a few problems while...
Martin> Staff's waiting if Doctor Crusher approves.
Alan> I checked into her record, too.  Her last posting was on Deriben Five. I spoke with her commanding officer there. He said she's argumentative... quick to take offense. He told me that he transferred Uhnari to this relay station because she was hampering their efforts.  To be honest, sir... I'm beginning to have doubts about her story.
Martin> Captain.
Ward> Not real...
Ward> Sir?
Ward> For Humans... the sexual act brings a closeness... an intimacy... it's a very pleasurable experience...  Inseminating a husk...
Alan> Data, I liked the captain's analogy better.
Alan> Mister Data, prepare three class five probes for launch. Mister Worf, begin compiling readings for transmission to Starfleet Headquarters.  Ensign... aft thrusters. Standard observation posture.
Alan> Excuse me, Ambassador. The Counselor and I are needed on the Bridge.
Ward> That would be ideal.
Martin> On screen.
Alan> And if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean it would fall off the edge of the world...
Alan> Are we able to talk? Is the area secure?
Ward> I guess a frontal assault is unwarranted. Stay here. I'm going to try an old-fashioned knock on the door.
Alan> How well do you know Spock?
Alan> I have no idea... no one's filed a flight plan...
Ward> Activate all security fields on decks eight through fifteen...
Ward> Another time. It's too close to our real contest.
Alan> We must have come full circle, sir.
Alan> Any word from the Jarada?
Ward> Do you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you?
Martin> Beverly?
Ward> Well, nice to have you here Ensign. There will be a briefing and indoctrination session as soon as you settle in.
Alan> All stop, Mister Crusher.
Martin> Proceed.
Alan> Where is Captain Picard? What have you done with Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data?
Alan> Mister Dokahchin, the information I need involves a matter of major importance to the Federation.
Martin> You said he made a pass... you forgot to mention whether it was successful or not...
Alan> I'm looking forward to proving my innocence...
Alan> You'll get only one shot.
Ward> And if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean it would fall off the edge of the world...
Ward> I knew who I was a second ago... I was on the ship... in a play...  It's getting harder to remember...
Martin> Captain, what do you intend to do?
Martin> I've never done this... and yet I know how.
Ward> How'd you know I was bluffing?
Ward> Devours vessels?
Ward> We're like a rag in a dog's mouth.
Ward> I recognize it, Captain... it's similar to that child's drawing...
Martin> Go to backup systems.
Martin> The optimist in the group.
Martin> We don't have time for this. You want power? This is power...  Bridge to Ensign Gomez...
Ward> Fan out. Let's find her.
Alan> But it's our boy -- roughly five times our mass and carrying enough armament to pulverize a planet.
Martin> No problem, Professor.
Ward> I'll try to make this as painless as possible. For both of us.  Do you assist your husband in his work?
Ward> There's got to be more to him than software, nets and chips.
Ward> Aye, sir.
Ward> Later.
Ward> Lock on tractor beam!
Alan> I was there... in Ward Forty-seven, just like in the play. Everyone thought I was insane... that I'd killed somebody...  Except it was all real.
Alan> And, who'll tuck him in at night?
Alan> Mister Data, you'll coordinate the evacuation of the colonists.  Doctor, they have nine patients in the outpost infirmary. Your priority will be getting them to Sickbay -- after that you'll stay aboard the Enterprise and be ready to receive casualties.  Marquez, you'll take some people down to track the storm -- you'll need to keep all teams apprised of its heading.  Commander, you'll coordinate the deployment of the deflectors.
Ward> Is there a mother ship we should advise of your condition?
Ward> If I'm right, you're not really here... and this isn't a real phaser...  It's all a fantasy, and I'm ending it no matter what it takes...
Alan> Phasers on stun, Lieutenant Worf.
Alan> I'm flattered. I don't know what to say.
Martin> I have absolutely no recollection of her... what was she like?
Ward> Now you know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here by accident.
Ward> Altered... ?
Martin> It's all right, sir, I'll see he leaves immediately...
Martin> Remember Wes, the purpose here is to improvise. It's the effort that counts.
Alan> Increase by ten to the third.
Ward> I know that... but -- you can't make someone... love you.
Martin> We make no effort to restrict access to our medical supplies.
Ward> Starfleet is stretched pretty thin across the quadrant. There are only twelve ships within one day's travel of this position.
Martin> My apologies, Doctor. A minor crisis...  in Engineering.
Martin> Doctor... I'm ready to take the Rheinman test.
Alan> The timing would be more difficult, and the risk greater.
Ward> Engineering, prepare to extend shields...
Alan> You've made yourself very clear, sir.
Ward> Ensign DeSeve. By order of Starfleet Command, you are hereby placed under arrest for treason.
Alan> Commence rapid fire with all weapons on full!
Alan> I'm not sure anybody ever is.
Ward> Who was on transporter duty when he came aboard?
Alan> Go, Data.
Ward> Captain Picard... Captain Benjamin Maxwell.
Alan> Keep trying, Mister O'Brien.
Ward> You of all people should know...
Martin> And that transmission --
Martin> Status of Borg power drive... ?
Alan> Now I know you're bluffing.
Martin> We have a distress call from the New Berlin Colony. They're under attack.
Martin> Great!
Martin> That's ah... going to be a little difficult right at the moment.
Ward> Rotate shield frequencies...  Data, report...
Alan> Look... if we're going to get out of here, you've got to trust me...
Ward> An entire planet obliterated... except for a few acres of trees and grass... and one building?
Martin> There's no power on the entire deck, but somehow these monitors are working.
Martin> Belay that.
Ward> Ah. Parthus... a la Yuta. I look forward to tasting it.
Ward> This creature that calls itself ARMUS is down on that planet waiting for us to come back. It wants us to come back. It killed Tasha. It could have just as easily killed us all. It didn't. Troi and Ben Prieto are still alive. For a reason. It wants something -- and it knows we will not leave so long as Troi and Ben are alive.
Alan> To smash your house of cards? No, it was the visual record of my "wife," Minuet. Bad move.
Martin> I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advance navigation at the Academy presents the student with three options. When Rice took the test, he rejected all of them and offered one of his own.
Alan> Ensign, take us away from it. One quarter impulse.
Ward> Is this another result of the interface experiment?
Martin> Thank you. You're dismissed.
Alan> We've locked onto something with markings on it.
Martin> Any sign of the Essex?
Ward> Mister Data, find out how that beam is getting through the shields and what we can do to cut it off.
Alan> To hope is to recognize the possibility. I had only dreams.
Ward> Agreed. Not only are they closely humanoid but their history has remarkable similarities to ours.
Martin> What'd she say?
Alan> And risk a war?
Alan> What?
Ward> What if you're wrong?
Ward> Your Captain has been sent back to the Ent--... back to our ship.  You would appear to be the senior officer left aboard.
Ward> But that's pure assumption. We still know virtually nothing about Manheim's work.
Ward> We can't leave Geordi behind --  I want the Pakleds on that screen and I want them now!
Martin> We just received the Yridian's flight plan from Deep Space Nine.
Alan> The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out. Data's coordinating the salvage effort right now.  Sir.
Martin> Take it easy, Wes. We'll find him. I want to begin a methodical search. Sensors on maximum scan We'll use our present location as the center. Data plot a search pattern from our present coordinates which will cover the most area in the shortest time.
Ward> I have no questions, your honor.
Martin> I think I'll summon our science officer --
Alan> Hold where you are Klag. I have relieved Captain Kargan. He was acting in an irrational manner. I am now your captain!!  Serve this ship as I have!
Alan> Why the devil would we be going there? Are there any miners or indigenous life forms on the planet?
Alan> A complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes turned up no surprises. No sign of life, nothing out of the ordinary.
Alan> This is not place or person we are facing... at least not yet... it's time.
Alan> Engage!
Ward> I do.
Ward> Open the channel, Mister Worf, and prepare to fire at target one.
Alan> Yes, sir.
Martin> Why?
Martin> -- No you can't. Don't even try.
Ward> No. It's not true...
Alan> I'm sure we won't.
Alan> Tilonus Four? Didn't their government just collapse?
Alan> Is there a problem?
Ward> Tell me, Professor, at what point does time travel become a tool for historians?
Alan> I just hope we find them before they come out of their nap.
Martin> We're going to give that barge a push into the Gamelan sun.
Alan> Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do it!
Ward> It still hurts...
Ward> The admiral... ?
Martin> Transporter Room, take us up.
Ward> Computer -- secure sickbay.
Alan> I've got this one!
Martin> Want to take her into orbit, Data?
Martin> Acknowledged.
Alan> Speaking of time, Lieutenant, this may be your time. I shall personally miss you.
Martin> Why isn't this ship being hit with radiation?
Alan> Beam him aboard, chief.
Ward> Isn't it?
Ward> Let's get in position.
Martin> Hi. It's that time again...
Ward> As he sits, and watches us struggle...
Alan> The Lenarians attacked us outside the conference room.
Alan> I do. Initiate auto-destruct sequence.
Martin> Problem, Geordi?
Ward> Well?
Ward> It took him twenty years too long.
Alan> We're due at Starbase Six in less than twelve hours. We thought you might enjoy a quick look at the bridge before we arrive.
Alan> On screen.
Martin> But I'm the first officer of this ship. I have to set an example.
Alan> I do, sir.
Martin> Go ahead...
Martin> I object, sir... There is no basis for calling Officer Tarses a liar.
Ward> Want to take her into orbit, Data?
Martin> You make it sound poetic.
Ward> Rivas. Rivas Jakara.
Alan> Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs... Uhnari might have been responsible for them.
Martin> How could a spaceship leave Earth without some kind of a record?
Ward> And who gets the unenviable task of prosecuting this case?
Alan> Forty-seven, including the captain of the Adelphi -- and two friends from my class at the Academy.
Martin> Where are the others?
Ward> Deanna... I don't know if you can hear me.  I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them... that it might even help stimulate the brain and speed the healing...  In fact, I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape...
Alan> That can certainly wait until we've recovered the survivors.
Martin> Recommend I lead an away team to the cruiser.
Alan> I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of these eruptions is awesome.
Martin> I was on the Enterprise. In the middle of a play...  Here... but it wasn't real... it was a stage...
Alan> Yes, sir.
Martin> For all we know, reversing course might be what leads us into the crash.
Ward> Here, sir. That was close.
Ward> I've been on my own since I was fifteen. I can take care of myself.
Alan> If it's changed intensity... it can't possibly be a protostar.
Alan> I don't have time for this.
Martin> Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf?
Martin> You heard me. A collision course.
Ward> Bridge, engage engines!
Alan> Are you here to work or play, Mister Crusher?
Ward> I wonder why they don't react to us, and why the Enterprise did not read any life signs, especially when there are this many.
Ward> Is there something I can take care of for you at Starbase five one five?
Alan> If it's any comfort, everybody's in the same situation. Stay put for now... we'll be back in touch.
Ward> ... so if we don't catch it on the first try, we'll have to chase it.
Alan> Where is Mister Barclay... it's past fourteen hundred hours...
Ward> A head injury?
Ward> Do it.
Alan> If we know it -- so do the Tamarians.  Riker to La Forge.
Martin> Data, those are two of your friends out there. They've saved your life more times than I can remember. I can't believe you'd be willing to sacrifice them like this.
Alan> We can't give the aliens any more time...
Alan> Which could start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war. And we still might not be able to save the captain.
Ward> Data... people don't have internal chronometers. See what happens when you turn yours off.
Martin> Very well. Fire when ready.
Alan> Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you?
Ward> I think you need to continue to develop --
Alan> I will be glad to be relieved of this cargo.
Martin> Come in...
Alan> I'll bet you I can find a card that you bury anywhere in this deck. And furthermore, I'll make you help me do it.
Alan> Now, will you help me?
Martin> That explains the accent...
Martin> Worf, prepare a scanner probe. Let's see what's in there.
Alan> I guess Starfleet training kicks in and takes over...
Ward> Is there anything on long range sensors?
Alan> It's just important to me... that I don't... let you down, Jean-Luc.
Alan> Okay. I'm looking for you.
Ward> Repair teams to Engineering... seal hull breach...
Martin> Why are you still here?
Ward> Too dangerous. We've seen what those tunnels look like. You could easily be cut off from the rest of us.  Worf, if we --
Ward> Frequency open, sir.
Ward> Lieutenant Marquez is already set up on the surface. Apparently the storm is still gaining speed -- he's estimating it'll hit the colony in less than fifty minutes.
Alan> Yes, sir. I checked on Geordi and Wesley a few hours ago.  For a moment there... I thought that the two of them were actually going to... hit one another.
Martin> Enjoy your dinner.
Martin> There was no direct contact with the Enterprise.
Alan> Force fields up. Arm photon torpedoes.
Alan> What is it, Deanna?
Martin> The signal ended abruptly at oh four five five... unable to raise them on subspace...
Martin> Sorry to interrupt. We're receiving an emergency distress signal from the Solarion Four colony.
Alan> I don't think this is a random occurrence. There is a purpose here -- a reason. What, I don't know.
Martin> The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse the impact...
Alan> Then, with your shields failing, sir...
Martin> Yes. If you believe those accusations, you should act on them.
Martin> I know how I'd feel if the situation were reversed... if they were in our territory, holding a Federation citizen.
Ward> We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend.
Alan> Is that what you want?
Martin> Status, Ensign?
Alan> Energize.
Ward> The cargo bays?
Martin> Deck fifteen. Only a few decks below the shuttlebay.
Martin> Riker here.
Alan> ... With this new extricator, sir, we could eliminate three other bulky machines from cargo space.
Ward> This is another change in Borg behavior... they left their dead behind instead of vaporizing them.
Alan> Old friends.
Ward> You call this healthy?
Alan> No.  Get ready to deploy the mines.
Martin> Lock on the captain and bring him back.
Martin> Then devise one! Fast!
Alan> I'm afraid so.
Martin> What is it?
Alan> Captain!
Martin> Ethan... I'll get us out of here...
Ward> Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.
Alan> Let's hope so for their sake.
Ward> No.
Ward> Captain, I think I should apologize.
Ward> Of course, Jean-Luc.
Ward> Aye, sir.
Ward> But it hasn't been approved by the chief engineer... or by me.
Alan> Yes... of course I do...
Martin> Confused.
Alan> Enterprise, we're in position.
Alan> Just tell her I'll be in Shuttlebay Two.
Martin> Captain, I have a schematic of the explosion site. It suggests the cause as a methane-like gas seeping in underground...
Martin> So that gives you the right to assault us, and rob us, and --
Alan> The Bynars!
Ward> You're gonna make us search through this to find him?
Martin> The dead one, I'm afraid.
Alan> Doctor.
Alan> Troi, Geordi, Worf... !
Alan> No indication of a base at all?
Martin> Maintain the approach attitude Data... I'm taking her in...
Alan> Energize.
Alan> Yes. Quite beautiful.
Ward> But I think I'm about to find out... stand by.
Martin> Let's greet our guest.
Alan> It's just that... For all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father... my son almost kills himself...
Alan> The fact it is traveling at its present velocity suggests an answer.
Martin> No...  You can't just snatch people away and put them in your fantasies... and expect them to respond.
Alan> Let's hope they stay clear of the colony.
Martin> Our destination is the Endicor system. We are not due to arrive for three days. The charts indicate nothing of consequence, certainly nothing which could threaten the Enterprise, between here and there.
Martin> Slow to impulse... time to intercept...
Alan> Deuce... Six...
Alan> I won't tell a soul, sir.
Alan> What about the doors, the ones we came in? If they stay open, would the system short out? Heat of that magnitude requires a seal of some sort, doesn't it?
Martin> And less enjoyable...
Ward> No, sir. We have an open channel.
Alan> Tasha -- I'm surprised. You mean you've never heard the stories about Aldea? A wonderous mythical world -- like Atlantis on ancient earth... or Neinman on Xerxes Seven... with an advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained, peaceful, with incredible technical sophistication which provided for every citizen's daily needs, allowing them to devote themselves to culture and art, which was beautiful beyond compare and valued beyond price.
Ward> Access all technical schematics of Lieutenant Commander Data.
Martin> They're going to take me whether I want to go or not.
Martin> Yes, dammit!
Alan> Narrow the scan field. Go deck by deck if you have to...
Martin> Okay, calibrate it to arc at six-point-three while I optimize the plasma flow.
Martin> Yuta... the wars are over.
Martin> Certainly is.
Ward> I'll be all right... just need to lie down a minute...
Martin> My lines. Why?
Alan> You may launch the probe when ready, Mister Worf.
Ward> Yes. If you believe those accusations, you should act on them.
Ward> Says who?
Alan> Helm, maintain relative position. Mister Worf, have Transporter Room Two stand by.
Alan> Thank you for coming on board, Mister Dokachin.
Martin> Excuse me.
Alan> How is he, Doctor?
Martin> We've seen it before -- we know what it is. Now get moving!
Alan> Data, what are you doing?
Alan> Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.
Ward> The Jarada.
Ward> Alright... here we go...
Ward> We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing for you to do now is to ask to get Tasha back.
Martin> The Sheliak may interpret that as a hostile act.
Alan> Good thing we didn't bring Data... we would've been unscrambling his circuits for a week...
Martin> So they could have appeared as Humans on Earth...
Martin> Then it could be a distress call.
Alan> Nice to meet'cha...
Alan> Bridge to engineering. What's your estimate on the engines, Geordi?
Martin> I'm going to explore the other floors; you two go down to the lobby, see if we've missed anything. Talk to the other "guests" -- try and find out who and what they are.
Ward> Here, sir. That was close.
Martin> Ishara?
Ward> I'm on my way.
Ward> Deck fifteen. Only a few decks below the shuttlebay.
Martin> Do it.
Martin> We found this inside.
Martin> ... are the phaser drilling sites.
Ward> Is she still underway?
Alan> Is he alive?
Alan> It's going to be all right... everything's going to be fine...
Alan> Was that an invitation?
Martin> That's suicide, Data.
Martin> On screen.
Martin> Sensors seemed to think there was...
Martin> Okona will have to shut down while we verify specifications.
Ward> Marking beam-out position. Return transport: fourteen minutes, forty seconds.
Alan> If you'll check your reports, you'll find that two of the colonists didn't survive.
Ward> Stand-by, La Forge...
Martin> Prepare to take us to an orbit above those coordinates.  Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
Martin> Good idea.
Ward> Probably just a symptom of stage fright --
Ward> Let's get out of here.
Martin> No extraterrestrial source has ever used this beacon?
Martin> How many of them were there?
Alan> No...
Ward> You stopped them. You gave us our shot.
Alan> Mister Worf... fire.
Martin> But they've got a monitoring satellite.
Ward> Engineering, this is the away team.
Alan> I wouldn't mind, sir.
Ward> They're in turbolift four.
Martin> If you don't, I'll relieve you of duty.
Martin> Use your sleeve.
Alan> Then I'll just have to muddle through... so be tolerant if a stray "he" or "she" slips by, okay?
Ward> I was just trying to imagine you as a hell-bent-for-leather young officer insulting a Nausicaan twice your size. I wish I'd gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc Picard.
Ward> An automaton. Made. Made by whom?
Alan> Then let's get to it.
Martin> Belay that order, Lieutenant. There's no time...
Martin> You mean, maybe we've come into this room, sat at this table and had this conversation a dozen times already?
Martin> Notify the Away Team we're going in ahead of schedule; I'll tell the Captain.
Martin> Mister Data and our guest appear to be tardy...
Martin> We think your system contains one of these null pockets.
Ward> It's bleeding again...  But how? You just healed it...
Martin> Doesn't matter. Would anyone argue with the captain once his decision was made?
Ward> Then we can throw the VISOR away?
Alan> I'm not exactly sure you can call it a recovery, sir.
Alan> More basic than that. What was he?
Alan> I say he folds.
Alan> I don't need your fantasy women, Q...
Ward> Acknowledged, Ensign. Begin launch sequence.
Alan> How long before they're fully conscious?
Ward> Are you saying there might be people living in there?
Martin> Come in, Lieutenant.
Alan> Permission to beam a box of Data's Chinese finger puzzles over to the Ferengi.  A "thank you" for all they tried to do.
Alan> Mister La Forge, prepare for precision station-keeping.
Ward> Their advanced technology could offer no solution.
Ward> The null space must be affecting the annular confinement beam...
Alan> Problem, Worf?
Ward> It is considered an honorable way for a Klingon to die, Doctor... a suicide that also takes an enemy.  Which one of them was it?
Martin> Affirmative. Enterprise out.
Martin> Well, now at least the waiting is over.
Martin> That's the file. It'll work now.
Martin> Agreed.
Martin> You wanted to see me, Data?
Ward> Helm, set course for Bersallis Three. Warp five.
Martin> Anything from the surface?
Ward> Let's find the others...
Martin> Long way from home.
Martin> Who? You can't mean Doctor Noonien Soong?
Ward> This is no way to live.
Alan> Can you be more specific, Counselor?
Alan> Understood.
Alan> I said I wouldn't mind the assignment.
Martin> No?
Alan> I think you do. The smartest thing you can do right now is to stay in your quarters and read a good book. Because if you make this situation any worse -- it'll be that much harder on you.
Ward> It seems impossible they could be draining all power from all systems.
Martin> Whenever you're ready, Chief.
Alan> We are running out of options.
Ward> I did. He just didn't like what I had to say.
Ward> I don't understand, sir. This is extremely frustrating.
Ward> I'm not surprised. How did you respond?
Ward> The doctor showed it to me, too. Harmless-looking thing, isn't it?
Martin> What about the doors, the ones we came in? If they stay open, would the system short out? Heat of that magnitude requires a seal of some sort, doesn't it?
Martin> From the history of my forebears? "Yankee Traders?"
Alan> Reflection Therapy then... when do we start?
Alan> Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We don't know what's going on down there; no need to take chances.
Alan> She needs our help.
Ward> Usually none. But it's been fitted with two type-four phaser emitters... we'll use them to chart the null space.
Martin> This meeting isn't for you, Wesley!
Martin> Fine, fine, Enterprise out!
Martin> Riker to sickbay. The captain's been hurt.
Martin> I'm sorry, Ambassador.
Ward> This is Commander Riker, aboard the Enterprise. We demand that you --
Alan> I knew another one of the Rossas who was killed in action at the Krasner outpost...
Ward> How's the environment?
Ward> If it looks secure at first glance, we'll proceed to the bridge.  If we find anyone alive, the medical team will beam over.
Ward> I'm concerned, sir. I've never seen him act like this.
Ward> Problem, Worf?
Martin> Yes... a restraint... it came down over my legs...  No, no... my chest... it came across my chest...
Alan> Doesn't it taste good?
Martin> Advise Mister Barclay to meet us on the bridge immediately...
Martin> Oh?
Ward> The injured Borg immediately self-destructed.
Alan> Don't tell me you're still concerned about my not weakening?
Martin> Go to impulse. Back us off.
Ward> Like intoxication but worse. Judgment almost completely impaired...
Ward> We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend.
Alan> I'd say it's a risk we have to take.
Alan> Uh... Wil, sir.
Alan> Which means we lack the ability to respond...
Alan> Our destination is the Endicor system. We are not due to arrive for three days. The charts indicate nothing of consequence, certainly nothing which could threaten the Enterprise, between here and there.
Martin> No good, Worf.
Martin> Look...
Alan> Engage!
Martin> Begin pre-launch sequence.
Alan> Take your best shot, Locutus, cause we're about to intervene.
Alan> Here's the situation on El-Adrel. The entity has moved off several hundred meters.
Alan> The Professor is scheduled to meet a Vulcan transport the day after tomorrow.
Alan> You brought it in ahead of schedule.
