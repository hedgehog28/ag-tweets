Martin> Solid propellant?
Alan> Hit by a disruptor blast two years ago. She lived for about a week. How about Fang-lee... Marla Aster... Tasha Yar... how many good men and women -- how many friends have we watched die? Even I've lost count. But every one of them -- every single one -- fought for life until the very end.
Martin> Captain, permission to withdraw from the Neutral Zone.
Alan> Don't be too quick to judge, Data. His pile's a lot bigger than yours.
Alan> Captain, may I have a word with you?
Martin> The "Children of Tama." I've heard rumors about them for years.
Martin> Then... what came aboard the station, was actually an organism that looked and acted like Rocha...
Martin> What about the doors, the ones we came in? If they stay open, would the system short out? Heat of that magnitude requires a seal of some sort, doesn't it?
Ward> Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems.
Martin> How close is it to the captain?
Martin> We have the ophidian...
Ward> Worf?
Alan> Did you find them all, Geordi?
Alan> I think it's time we talked to the captain about Broccoli.  That's what Wesley calls him. Keep it to yourself.
Ward> I've worked hard.
Ward> It's worth a try.
Ward> It's all about you, isn't it? You're the only constant... the only person in both places...
Ward> Anyone notice anything unusual?  No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask?
Ward> I gave you an order, Lieutenant.
Alan> Do you have anything else on them?
Alan> Come in.
Ward> Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski. I'm the first officer, Commander William Riker. This is...
Ward> Is there anything here we can try to adapt to our current defense systems... ?
Ward> But I'm still not confident about that final speech...
Ward> I would like to make one suggestion, sir.
Martin> Never cared for it.
Alan> This room... it's more than just a Holodeck, isn't it?
Martin> What? Computer, emergency order to Transporter Room Three...
Alan> Geordi, are you --
Ward> It's very beautiful. I'll arrange for you to see it, if you like.
Ward> Which raises the question of how to get Junior off the hull when we get there...
Martin> I think we can relax, Worf. They can't even get their ship moving without our help, and we certainly have them outmanned and outgunned.
Alan> You think we'll need to put in to a starbase?
Alan> Status, Ensign.
Alan> Has he been... like a father to you?
Martin> Then he must be hurt... or dead.  How long before another window, Data?
Ward> It's odd the Enterprise wasn't advised...
Alan> Is there something I can take care of for you at Starbase five one five?
Alan> Let's hope so for their sake.
Martin> He could have killed you. He didn't. Maybe the end begins with one boy putting down a gun.
Alan> Hold your position.
Ward> What is it, Data?
Ward> Soren --
Alan> Eternity never looked so lovely.
Ward> Captain! The engines can't take this strain.
Alan> Geordi, start scanning the probe for any identifying marks, anything that might tell us where it came from.
Martin> La Forge, open hailing frequencies.
Ward> There's not much damage... doesn't look like they were interested in the station... just the people...
Alan> Mister Data, I gave you a direct order. Release the Transporter lock-out. Now.
Ward> Tell them to stand by. If this works, we'll be on our way.
Martin> What is it?
Martin> What are you saying Lieutenant?
Ward> Captain, La Forge is trying a neutrino infusion. There's a chance it'll smother the reaction...
Martin> Come on, move it!
Ward> Close call.
Martin> Sir, shall I send for Doctor Crusher?
Martin> It's getting harder to bluff you, Data. You've learned this game well.
Alan> I took advantage...
Ward> And now it's here.
Alan> We're very proud of her.
Ward> We've received a distress call from the Ohniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack.
Ward> Captain, I believe we've got the answer to what happened over there.
Alan> How do you feel?
Martin> On screen.
Alan> It is only fair to mention Wesley in a log entry, sir.
Martin> A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans?
Alan> Are you sure? I get the sense you're feeling pretty noble about the whole thing.  Look at Worf... isn't he courageous? Isn't he an honorable Klingon?
Alan> Shields at forty percent, Captain. We can maneuver on impulse.
Alan> Could some kind of damping field cause us to lose velocity?
Martin> Did you know him, Captain?
Martin> Oh, he's a Klingon, and that requires a little more explanation.
Alan> Deanna... I don't know if you can hear me.  I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them... that it might even help stimulate the brain and speed the healing...  In fact, I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape...
Martin> I've decided not to pursue the commission at this time.
Alan> Nice work, Geordi, now what's the possibility for warp drive?
Ward> So what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding a way to make the computer think someone else is Data? Maybe a few someone elses?
Martin> Course set by whom?
Alan> I'm not willing to let that thing keep drilling into him --
Alan> Forty five point three hours, sir.
Alan> No intruder noted by the ship's sensors, Captain...
Martin> The Coalition and the Alliance are all that's left?
Martin> Rivas. Rivas Jakara.
Ward> Geordi, fire up the impulse engines and activate the ship's stabilizers...
Martin> When we're through here, double-check the sensor logs.
Alan> What happens here...
Ward> The trick is to make a knot that tightens under pressure. Here, I'll show you...
Martin> Cease fire.
Ward> We're too close.
Ward> From the beginning, please.
Martin> We have a distress call from the New Berlin Colony. They're under attack.
Alan> You don't sound convinced.
Alan> Security to the bridge!
Ward> Mister Data. We've got a very sick boy on the Enterprise who's not getting any better. And we're dead in the water until you get us out of here.
Alan> Deanna...
Martin> Nicely done... I hope you know what you're doing.
Alan> I'd say that fellow Devinoni's the one to watch out for...
Alan> Mister Data will need access to your library.
Martin> -- Twelve. They only had a notion to fly away.
Alan> My quarters are full of things that used to be yours. I figured you should at least have this.
Ward> Obviously nothing we have now can stop them.
Alan> They're some kind of magnetometric-guided charges.
Alan> Where is Captain Picard? What have you done with Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data?
Martin> I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars... And all the universe worships night.
Martin> I'll see your hundred and call.
Ward> No, sir. And we haven't been able to raise them since the initial call.
Ward> You do this every day?
Martin> We can't leave Geordi behind --  I want the Pakleds on that screen and I want them now!
Martin> Really?
Alan> Yes, we're from a ship called the Enterprise. We monitored your distress call but you never acknowledged our response.
Martin> Right.
Martin> We spent some time together. Not very well.
Alan> We should have an engine core ready for them by nineteen hundred hours.
Alan> Good idea.
Ward> I'm just your average everyday human who happens to be a commander. Now what are your orders?
Alan> Bridge, this is Commander Riker. We are taking the survivors to Sickbay.
Martin> Spooky.  Riker.
Ward> To an Earth woman, I'd lie.  But you'd know it if I did.
Alan> Are you saying that Lieutenant Rocha was killed by one of these -- organisms?
Martin> Their sensors should have picked us up...
Martin> "When in Rome... ," eh?
Ward> What? Wesley, if you've something to report...
Ward> And if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean it would fall off the edge of the world...
Martin> It's confirmed. The MS One colony is under attack.
Martin> Delusion... it couldn't be a delusion. I was there...
Ward> You think this is funny?
Alan> Inertial dampers compensating...
Martin> Captain, I hardly think the vine that struck me did so out of malice.  If I've learned anything aboard this ship... from our voyages... from you... it's that most life forms act out of an instinct for survival -- not out of evil.
Ward> Aye, aye, sir.
Ward> Forty-eight minutes... I think we're down to splitting hairs.
Ward> You mean without a woman having to tell him?
Alan> Is there any way to get through to them?
Ward> But certainly, history never meant this ship to be led into battle without your captain.
Martin> I understand. Thank you, Lieutenant.
Ward> What is it?
Ward> Shields up. Go to Red Alert!
Martin> No, thank you.
Martin> Why don't we get going... ?
Martin> You were right. Somebody blew the hatch and they were all sucked out into space..
Alan> ... and that you might have thought it was a line.
Ward> Where is Mister Barclay... it's past fourteen hundred hours...
Alan> We didn't make it, Captain. If we had just a minute or so more...
Ward> Friendship is something we carry in our hearts... We can feel it wherever we are.
Martin> Commander Shelby, report...
Ward> And not even a thank you.
Alan> Aye, sir.
Alan> We're meeting in the Observation lounge at fourteen hundred hours to draw up a mission plan.
Ward> One hundred twenty-five, sir
Alan> Your house -- with your permission I'd like to look inside.
Alan> Any signs of life, Mister La Forge?
Ward> Define "weird".
Ward> You're dismissed, Mister Crusher.
Alan> Release control of this ship.
Alan> There are no civilians among the Borg.
Ward> You're just... delusions...
Alan> It's comforting to know I'm with an expert Data, but we're really not going to be there that long.  Computer...
Ward> What can you tell us?
Alan> Speaking of Klingons...
Martin> Please don't think that you have heard the last of this, Mister Potts.
Alan> Captain, we have a plan.
Alan> But it's just an unimportant detail...
Ward> Report. What did you find?
Alan> Can you be more specific?
Martin> The first words out of your mouth are the most important. You could start by saying something like...  ... "you're the most beautiful woman in the galaxy."
Alan> He ordered us to withdraw?
Ward> That was my first thought. But the Vulcans don't have any record of stolen weapons. Or stolen parts, for that matter.
Martin> It is far more likely that I'm a weather balloon than an alien.
Alan> Counselor...
Martin> And I give it back to you now.
Ward> They seem to be in an awful hurry.
Martin> Set a course to intercept...
Alan> You're putting too much pressure on the mouthpiece. Relax. Just use the muscles you need.
Martin> I feel kind of... confused.
Ward> You haven't decided what you're going to do.
Martin> Yet, this "hole" has a form, Data. It has height, width...
Alan> Could you be more specific?
Martin> Speaking of Klingons...
Martin> It needs a little more help.
Martin> Well, it's a Federation shuttle all right.
Martin> None of this is real --
Alan> Doctor Apgar? I'm Commander William Riker; Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge.
Alan> ... he still won't talk... so they put the Count's head on the chopping block... 'one more chance' says the Queen. 'No' says the Count. The headsman swings his axe and just as the blade falls, the Count says 'Wait, wait, I'll talk!' but it was too late. And the moral to the story is don't hatchet your counts before they chicken.
Alan> Could this be some sort of... tissue regeneration?
Martin> Go ahead, Data.
Ward> He couldn't understand why I did it.
Martin> Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the deck.
Martin> I can't stay here... I have to get back...
Ward> Everything we've seen suggests otherwise.
Alan> Flattered.  Sort of.
Martin> Starfleet does.
Alan> I need a code -- a password -- to access the file.
Alan> Away team to Enterprise. Medical Emergency.
Alan> I take it he found something wrong in Engineering?
Alan> How can he leave?
Alan> Chief, they're not here. Do you have them?
Ward> Permission to speak freely, sir?
Ward> Solid propellant?
Ward> How can we be sure he's not an imposter? God knows we've run into enough of them.
Ward> We're studying the sensor logs and torpedo telemetry to see if there was any malfunction... if we can discover the problem, another test might be successful.
Alan> Captain, the Black Cluster is distorting the sensors. We're picking up echoes of the Enterprise reflecting off the wavefronts.
Ward> I'm not that far gone, am I?
Martin> ... Velocity - warp factor five.
Martin> Mister Worf's what?
Martin> What?
Martin> Storm front going to affect the transport, Chief... ?
Alan> I still have the phaser... why do I still have the phaser?
Alan> Of us. Of what we could become...
Alan> No.
Martin> Apparently, Deanna's being aboard was only part of the reason.
Martin> It's not that we don't believe you; it's just hard to see how both our stories could be true.  Would you be willing to let our Doctor check you out?
Ward> Yes, but I've had it. Let's put all this technology and computers to work -- figure out what's going on -- and get the hell out of here.
Alan> It's Riker, sir. Your Number One. Look for a silver sphere...
Ward> I repeat... you have entered a Federation depot... identify yourself.
Martin> They were all in an open locker. I don't think he was too concerned with security.
Alan> I play the trombone too...
Alan> What is the nature of your mission?
Martin> It's just a study of a proto-star cloud. The Enterprise will be returning tomorrow.
Martin> If we take the time to try to communicate with this thing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we can risk that.
Ward> That's nearly the size of Earth's orbit around the sun.
Alan> How long until the transport window opens?
Alan> Tactical analysis.
Ward> I didn't want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding.
Martin> Thank you, sir.
Alan> Recommendations.
Alan> Warm milk toddy... you're kidding.
Alan> Depends how they get along.
Martin> Good evening.
Alan> Out, out out! Let's go!
Ward> That would be ideal.
Martin> Your honor, I offer into evidence prosecution's exhibit A. A bar of plasteel with a tensile strength of forty kilo-bars.
Martin> You haven't used my first name once, Paul.
Alan> What would you do?
Martin> We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms.
Ward> Data... put the turbolifts back on line. If Danar sees they're operating, he may try to use one.
Ward> I feel... terrible. But thanks to you, I'm much better now. And I feel confident that when I leave, I'll be ready to take my place in society again.
Ward> We'll stay out of your way, it's just that we've never seen a terraforming station, and couldn't resist the opportunity.
Alan> What is it?
Alan> Curious isn't exactly the way I'd describe it.
Alan> What ship were you on?
Alan> I know you are a computer-generated image... but your smell, the way you feel, your touch, even the way you talk and think is so real.
Alan> How did all of this ever get started?
Alan> On my way.
Alan> Shields up. Red alert.
Martin> Sorry.
Martin> The fact it is traveling at its present velocity suggests an answer.
Martin> Is our channel secure on your end?
Martin> I have no such intentions, Captain.
Ward> I'm fine. I'm just...
Alan> Run the simulation.
Ward> Do you need help?
Ward> Captain... with your permission, I've decided to remain on the Enterprise.
Martin> There's obviously been some misunderstanding...
Ward> Ethan... no!
Alan> Aye, sir, it is.  As they say, sir... you're the captain.
Ward> I suppose Pacifica can wait a little longer.
Alan> Sure, what's on your mind?
Martin> Troi, stand by...
Alan> No.
Martin> I knew he'd have a great time.
Ward> Worf.
Martin> What if we detonated a low-yield photon torpedo within the particle stream? Wouldn't that shut it down?
Alan> The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronic net would be ionized within minutes. I can't let you sacrifice yourself.
Ward> Why hasn't anybody noticed this before?
Ward> Amanda...
Ward> But why... ?  Unless there's something they want us -- something they need us to see...
Martin> Chief, they're not here. Do you have them?
Alan> Let's go!
Alan> Did you hear that, Data?
Martin> Isn't Manheim the one who was thrown out of the Institute for unauthorized experiments?
Ward> Captain, I recommend we transfer all power to phasers, and arm the photon torpedos.
Ward> Look... why don't I talk to Commander La Forge... maybe there's something in Engineering.
Martin> Actually, they think highly of us, Troi. We have a quality of... of growth which they admire...
Martin> Mister Worf, extend shields around the ship and lock on a tractor beam.
Martin> How current is your information, Data?
Martin> Engage impulse engines.
Martin> Yar, Data.
Martin> The Menthars hide them in the floating debris... and an unsuspecting enemy ship flies in... instant booby trap.
Martin> ... With this new extricator, sir, we could eliminate three other bulky machines from cargo space.
Alan> "You control every move... tell me what to eat, what to think, what to say... "
Martin> What's that?
Alan> Lieutentant La Forge to bridge...
Martin> On the way.
Ward> What?
Ward> No... I don't know...  Maintain your original course, Ensign...
Alan> How are you? Did the shielding work?
Ward> Yes, but still... to seal someone up inside a Class Eight Probe and then just launch it off...  Hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary.
Martin> There are more over here...
Alan> How... will you...
Alan> Mister O'Brien, report...
Alan> Describe it.
Martin> I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
Alan> People don't just appear and disappear... there has to be some way to track her...
Martin> All right, sir. Deck Eight.
Martin> Oh... since we have some time before reaching Braslota --  I was hoping that you would agree to play me in a game of Strategema.
Alan> Counselor... a perfect job for you.
Ward> That depends on how you're doing.
Ward> You're back, Geordi...
Ward> Whoever did this... may still be on board.
Ward> Ninety-eight?
Ward> Can you make balso tonic?
Martin> If I open that entrance and it's still out there, we're dead.
Alan> Geordi, are you --
Martin> Fairness?! You disrupt this ship -- kidnap the captain!
Alan> We've arrived a little late...
Alan> Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's broken...
Ward> There are none, sir. Not that any of us can find.
Martin> Yes sir.
Martin> Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ours can.  Riker to O'Brien. Report.
Alan> Will they still be able to dissipate the wave?
Martin> Go ahead, Data.
Martin> The way Mendrossen described him, I expected him to be a frail old man.
Ward> Data, I can't help you -- I don't know these people; I haven't talked to them. You have. Use that fancy positronic brain of yours -- and carry out your mission.
Alan> She offers him everything. All we offer is the cold reality of his mother's death.
Alan> Let me get this straight -- Deanna was impregnated by... by what?  Doctor, what do your tests show? Is it a humanoid? An alien?
Alan> It's moving, sir.
Alan> Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts.
Ward> We are on the bridge -- there's a good chance this is our ship.
Alan> Oh? I would have thought otherwise.
Alan> I know... but this time it's different. He's different. I can't put my finger on it... but I'm worried.
Martin> Even Danar can't move that fast.
Alan> Tailor made for their victims...
Alan> Understood, Captain.  Mister La Forge, Doctor...
Alan> He could be dying by inches...
Martin> Computer. Summarize service record. Riker, William T., Captain. Beginning with... the Fornax Disaster.
Martin> Hold on that. There may be another way. I'll keep you informed.
Ward> D'Amato's been an exemplary officer.
Alan> Why are you still here?
Ward> How can he leave?
Ward> Powerful enough...
Martin> From what I could see, the ambassador doesn't need to be protected from anything.
Ward> No offense, Worf... but I have trouble believing that the man I just escorted to deck eight is... supernatural.
Ward> You're suggesting they were fugitives?
Alan> Set a course, Ensign.
Ward> I don't have time for this.
Alan> This just came in from Starfleet--
Martin> Has he been... like a father to you?
Ward> Understood.
Ward> He's the most comfortable man in the group...
Alan> Re-programming them... ?
Alan> Go ahead.
Ward> It didn't spare everyone, Doctor.
Ward> Like you said... our choices are very limited.
Martin> Data, I need help in locating some library-computer information.
Martin> No extraterrestrial source has ever used this beacon?
Alan> I'll prepare an away team.
Ward> But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey.
Ward> Couldn't we just blow it into harmless chunks?
Ward> Carmen... do you have some construction started I don't know about?
Ward> Come.
Martin> Not the response we expected.
Ward> Almost as much as I had to learn when I came aboard as Captain Picard's first officer. He reminded me of that fact when I commented on what a pain in the neck you are.
Alan> Yeah... I felt trapped by the console...  But it wasn't like this... there was something else here...
Martin> It's too heavy. We need something to help us.
Ward> Then, why -- in all of our history -- has there never been a record of you or someone like you having visited us?
Ward> No... I don't know...  Maintain your original course, Ensign...
Ward> Looks to me like you need a break... unwind a little.
Alan> I need those phasers --
Ward> The Borg...
Ward> Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields?
Alan> Because they're not through coming after us! Geordi, Wesley -- prepare warp jump.
Martin> Why the devil would we be going there? Are there any miners or indigenous life forms on the planet?
Alan> You bet. Dying is bad enough -- but losing my sense of humor? Forget it.
Martin> Is something wrong, Captain?
Martin> Understood.
Alan> You know why. Because I don't belong here. Because I have to get back to my ship in space.
Martin> Then... what came aboard the station, was actually an organism that looked and acted like Rocha...
Ward> There's a certain look in your eyes. I know... you used to have it for me.
Martin> That's not enough...
Ward> We can't leave Geordi behind --  I want the Pakleds on that screen and I want them now!
Martin> Well...
Ward> So without any regard to the risk of coming down alone...
Martin> What is it?
Martin> If this is a knife... what happened to Mavek?
Alan> My quarters are full of things that used to be yours. I figured you should at least have this.
Martin> Captain Picard, come in.
Ward> This is Commander Riker.
Ward> Damage report.
Alan> One could get the feeling they don't exactly trust us.
Martin> I got out with the last of the colonists. If it hadn't been for the perimeter teams, we wouldn't have made it.
Martin> I agree. We're at war.
Ward> Not bothering to cloak themselves.
Alan> Thank you. Now the first thing I think we should discuss is this...
Alan> Counselor...
Alan> Then why are you all so excited?
Martin> Engage!
Ward> It's working. I think we'll be able to give Commander La Forge the information he needs.
Ward> That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract them.
Ward> What's your name, and tell me you love jazz.
Martin> Wesley!  He'd been manning that station for me. I forgot.
Martin> Yes, sir.
Ward> Professor Galen hailed me from his shuttle an hour ago. He suggested that we surprise you.
Alan> But it paid off -- he received the top mark. And now that test has four options. The original three... plus his.
Alan> Have external sensors detected anything out of the ordinary?
Ward> You've been down here "dozens" of times -- I'm sure you know the best way.
Martin> You... tongue-tied?
Ward> I assumed as much. Captain, we have located the remains of a human.
Ward> Worf, you can't assume its intent is belligerent.
Ward> Help is all they're going to get. They certainly can't force anything upon us, can they?
Martin> That's not part of the plan.  Pipe it through.
Ward> Our position has not changed. We are returning him to Starfleet.
Alan> Commander Data, what are you?
Martin> No.
Alan> I wouldn't want to be in the Transporter Room to greet her.
Martin> Which explains our Ferengi's interest...
Alan> We're gonna have to find a way to modify the scanners to penetrate those storms. Got any ideas, Data... ?
Alan> Which is?
Martin> I've worked out the new rotation schedules. I'd like you to cross check the personnel assignments and notify all department heads.
Ward> We would like time to prepare our people for assimilation.
Ward> I've been in every room. There's nothing unusual about this house except that it's here. What about them?
Ward> I don't need explanations.
Martin> Can you treat it?
Martin> But what about Risa?
Alan> We don't have that kind of time.
Martin> Activate all security fields on decks eight through fifteen...
Ward> Not yet.
Martin> Maybe we ought to pay a visit to the Tripoli...
Ward> We should have. We're on a reverse course.
Martin> There is nothing of that nature on board the Enterprise.
Ward> And of course, your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry is unmatched.
Alan> Congratulations, sir!
Ward> Looks like the poor devil died in its sleep.
Martin> Were they with you...  ... or with you?
Ward> Let's give it a try.
Ward> I hate everything about it... the casual disregard for life... the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honor. I may have to respect your beliefs... but I don't have to like them.
Ward> Begin pre-launch sequence.
Martin> I'm sure you'd find their sybaritic outlook on life very appealing.
Martin> I do not mean to be indelicate, but...  ... who's the father?
Alan> The way Mendrossen described him, I expected him to be a frail old man.
Martin> Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computer has been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world to our computer.
Alan> Jean-Luc.
Martin> Medical emergency! Doctor Pulaski to the bridge.
Ward> I'll try to make this as painless as possible. For both of us.  Do you assist your husband in his work?
Alan> Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf?
Martin> Have I said something wrong... ?
Ward> Understood, sir.
Martin> Who went back to his ship? Damn it, Data, what's going on?!
Ward> Halt.
Martin> Riker here.
Martin> Any recommendations?
Martin> Speed being the obvious one. This ship literally thinks what it wants to do and it happens.
Martin> The null space must be affecting the annular confinement beam...
Alan> He couldn't understand why I did it.
Martin> Helm a hundred eighty degrees about.  Get us out of here, Geordi...
Alan> I understand.
Alan> He's going to be a hell of a gymnast.
Martin> I think the captain understands that.
Martin> Two. And another three hundred.
Alan> I know... like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Ward> We can give it one more try. More than that and we won't have enough power to get ourselves out of here.
Ward> Leyor, the Federation would like to negotiate a trade agreement to acquire your planet's rich deposits of Trillium 323 which we will add to our bid, Premier Bhavani...
Ward> I thought they were supposed to be back on-line yesterday.
Martin> The Sheliak may interpret that as a hostile act.
Martin> Beverly thinks its going to be tight. Let's hope he didn't take us too far off course.
Ward> How did you do this?
Ward> Goodnight.
Ward> Now!
Ward> Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV?
Ward> They must not know I'm taking medication...
Alan> She's not the Enterprise.  With all due respect, sir, you need me. Particularly now.
Ward> How come there's no record of other future historians traveling back to witness "important events?"
Martin> What I need is to get out of this cell. I'm locked up day and night... you control every move... tell me what to eat, what to think, what to say...
Ward> Speed being the obvious one. This ship literally thinks what it wants to do and it happens.
Martin> I can't stay here... I have to get back...
Martin> Maybe we should discuss this at your next evaluation...
Martin> Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar zero-zero-six at warp seven.
Alan> The colonists are all on board, sir.
Alan> Sorry... a little dizzy...
Martin> We don't have that kind of time.
Martin> Understood, Lieutenant. Return to the Enterprise.
Alan> The scattering field is still in full force.  What the hell is wrong with them?
Martin> I repeat... you have entered a Federation depot... identify yourself.
Martin> Transporter Code Fourteen?
Alan> Jenna knows that. And she's obviously decided to take the chance. Data, when it really works between two people, it's like nothing you've ever experienced -- the rewards are far beyond simple friendship.
Alan> No.
Martin> Are you playing or not?
Ward> It's the Brattain, all right.
Ward> We're out. We beat it.
Martin> I know you are a computer-generated image... but your smell, the way you feel, your touch, even the way you talk and think is so real.
Ward> Engineering?
Martin> Helm, maintain relative position. Mister Worf, have Transporter Room Two stand by.
Ward> All right. I can't make you come with us. Are you familiar with one of these... ?
Alan> Reset subspace communications to scrambler code Riker One...
Martin> No, but if Troi was right, we weren't far away from it...
Alan> Is something supposed to be happening here?
Martin> Excuse me...
Martin> Go to yellow alert.
Ward> What's a knockout like you doing in a computer-generated joint like this?
Ward> I wonder why they don't react to us, and why the Enterprise did not read any life signs, especially when there are this many.
Ward> Mister Barclay, I'm tired of seeing your name on report.  I don't know what you got away with on your last posting, but this is the Enterprise. We set a different standard here. Understood?
Martin> Yes... probably true... but, she will be difficult to forget.
Ward> Help me? But I heard you cry out.
Ward> Yes, dammit!
Martin> Sir, you can't believe they'd relieve you from command...
Ward> Solid propellant?
Alan> But I did win. I was gambling that you wouldn't call.
Martin> I need help. I don't want to be at the mercy of these hallucinations any more.
Martin> You're going to need this.
Ward> Red Alert.
Ward> Easier?
Ward> Not now, Wes.
Martin> Yes, sir. Worf check the outer perimeter -- carefully. And Data...
Ward> What is our mission?
Martin> A friendly one, I hope.
Martin> You have the look of someone who didn't come up here to relax.
Ward> I'll arrange for a technician to help you program your recipes into the computer. I'd like to try some myself. What's your specialty?
Ward> I miss you. So don't stay away too long, okay?
Alan> Now you know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here by accident.
Ward> They obviously need our help.
Martin> ... Why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the Odin survivors?
Alan> We are going to need torches -- head high.  ... and what else?
Martin> Response?
Martin> By blowing into warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once...
Martin> No. I've thought and thought about it. I don't have an answer.
Ward> Did anybody in the theater see anything strange happen during the performance?
Alan> The pain is gone... thank you...
Ward> I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.
Alan> Our mediator is very...  ... self assured.
Ward> Captain, that large mass to port may contain an assimilator.
Martin> Commander Data, check all systems... Medical personnel to the bridge.
Martin> Captain... Captain...
Martin> If we positioned a shuttle far enough in front of the Enterprise... it could detect the pockets and provide us enough time to maneuver out of the way.
Alan> That's more power than our entire ship can generate.
Martin> You know what to do?
Ward> Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapon-systems -- even in a computer mock-up -- can't hope to defeat the Enterprise.
Ward> O'Brien -- get him out of there!
Martin> Beverly...
Ward> She says he is too ill to join her.
Alan> Energize.
Alan> Course set by whom?
Ward> We've reached the designated coordinates.
Alan> As Captain Picard would say -- make it so, Mister Data.
Ward> I realize it will be disturbing, Governor... but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that I am Odan... I have his thoughts, his memories, his skills...
Ward> I thought the Tarellians were finished! What are the poor devils doing here?
Martin> Bridge.  Do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure before you make them?
Ward> Just like the Brattain.
Martin> Data, you beat him!
Alan> You're not in a position to dictate to anybody. She attacked two Federation officers.
Alan> The storm's going to interfere with communications -- everything'll have to be coordinated from the surface.
Alan> I don't see the connection...
Ward> The inquiry is only a formality... you know the Captain will support you all he can.
Ward> She's bought us some time... let's make the most of it.
Ward> What did you say, Commander?
Alan> I'm sorry, Worf... but I can't help you. There's only one person on board who can do that.
Ward> It's still being debated in some quarters. But I think so, yes.
Martin> Yes.
Alan> Never mind.
Ward> We've received a distress call from the Ohniaka Three Outpost. They said they were under attack.
Martin> Status of the Borg weapons...
Ward> What's this all about?
Alan> I understand.
Ward> Survivors on Orelious Nine after all this time... not possible.
Alan> Shut down all active sensors, passive scanners only. Deflectors to minimum emissions.
Martin> Lieutenant La Forge says we will be able to engage the warp drive within the hour.
Alan> Eight-one-four, yes. So your conclusions about the secret base are solely based on a few files you happened to see in a computer.
Alan> Nothing... it just fizzled out...
Martin> Data... put the turbolifts back on line. If Danar sees they're operating, he may try to use one.
Alan> Medical emergency! Doctor Pulaski to the bridge.
Alan> No intruder noted by the ship's sensors, Captain...
Alan> A complete analysis of our bid is available on the ship's computer for your consideration, Premier... If I may summarize...
Alan> Human beings have another way of doing that. We have children.
Ward> Destroy that probe!
Alan> Hey, hold on, we've gotta coordinate our efforts here...
Ward> This is our only chance to destroy them... if they get back into warp, our weapon becomes useless.
Martin> You have the authority to countermand it.
Martin> I know this must be... very hard for you.
Alan> Position security teams at both entrances...
Martin> It's not that familiar to me...  Data?
Alan> Prepare to take us to an orbit above those coordinates.  Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
Ward> I'm in.
Alan> Bridge.
Alan> Doctor.
Alan> But for how long -- these Solari don't seem likely candidates for peace.
Ward> They're worried... they're worried that we've got access to Picard... we've got two minutes to figure out what we can do with it...
Martin> Who is that?
Martin> Mister Data, prepare three class five probes for launch. Mister Worf, begin compiling readings for transmission to Starfleet Headquarters.  Ensign... aft thrusters. Standard observation posture.
Alan> The optimist in the group.
Martin> Captain, the entire crew has been wiped out.
Ward> Captain?
Martin> Morning? I just went to bed...
Alan> It's a long story, Mister Worf... I'll brief you later.
Martin> It's going to be all right... everything's going to be fine...
Alan> A complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes turned up no surprises. No sign of life, nothing out of the ordinary.
Alan> To the left. All right. Let's do it.
Martin> -- Are you kidding? That joke's become a legend on this ship.
Ward> I'm not willing to let that thing keep drilling into him --
Ward> Lay in the course.
Alan> It would take a powerful weapon to do this...
Martin> You heard me. A collision course.
Martin> Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up.
Alan> And I doubt they're prepared to cope with the kind of cold that's coming.
Alan> Thirteen-sixty-five-baker. That should put us near shuttlebay two.
Martin> The Enterprise is too far out of range.
Ward> You know of the simulation. What do you think?
Ward> But Captain...
Martin> Certainly a perfect match for Data, sir.
Ward> Data? Data!
Martin> That's the file. It'll work now.
Martin> Are you recommending they be transferred to the Enterprise?
Martin> Certainly is.
Alan> Worf, prepare to activate gamma pulse generators.
Martin> The feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart.
Alan> Now, computer -- someone to play with. A combo. Say, drums upright bass...piano. And a 'bone for me.
Ward> Captain?...
Alan> We can't just sit here.
Martin> We have some gaps in the aft shields, Captain.  When the torpedoes explode, these areas will be contaminated with ion radiation.
Alan> Devours vessels?
Ward> I spent too much time practicing in the mirror to be fooled by that face. You're bluffing.
Martin> On screen.
Alan> Doctor, we've located the soliton wave. It's still on course for Lemma Two... but its velocity has increased to warp four point one.
Alan> Increase shields to seventy-five percent.
Martin> And, who'll tuck him in at night?
Ward> Our position has not changed. We are returning him to Starfleet.
Ward> Did you want to be alone with that?
Martin> There was nothing provocative about what she did.
Ward> Very good, sir.
Alan> Fire all weapons.
Alan> Nor do I... but I know that silence will injure us...
Alan> I feel kind of... confused.
Martin> Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's all just... window dressing for a dead man.
Martin> Damage report, Mister Data.
Alan> Destroy that probe!
Alan> This is not a battle, Lieutenant.
Ward> Open hailing frequencies.
Martin> What he means is, what planet is this?
Ward> And that surprises you, Doctor?
Alan> How do you feel?
Alan> I guess I really wasn't paying attention...  I'd better get to Sickbay. We'll pick this up later.
Alan> That's it? What's the emergency?
Alan> I was being polite. I could've won in twenty moves.
Alan> Fire thrusters... gradual acceleration to forty percent power.
Martin> How much protection will this cave give us, Data?
Martin> Geordi... wait a second.
Alan> Resting in his quarters...  ... after ordering both of you to your duty stations.
Alan> I leave that to you.
Ward> Little change, Captain. The shields are still inoperable. We have partial control of our weapons. I've doubled the repair crews.
Ward> It certainly is.  We'll try to make you as comfortable as possible.
Ward> So, all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer was damaged... ?
Ward> It's okay. But Fontana should stay where he is.
Ward> Under the circumstances -- I think you may be right.
Alan> Go ahead.
Alan> Destroy that probe!
Ward> If we don't get our command computers back on-line soon, this -- whatever this is -- won't matter. We'll all be dead.
Alan> Computer. Summarize service record. Riker, William T., Captain. Beginning with... the Fornax Disaster.
Martin> I enjoy a challenge.
Ward> I'm just your average everyday human who happens to be a commander. Now what are your orders?
Martin> And you, Mister Data, bear a striking resemblance to one Friar Tuck.
Martin> Damage report.
Ward> How far have these negotiations progressed?
Martin> Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you. Dinner tonight?
Ward> It's odd the Enterprise wasn't advised...
Ward> We mean you no harm. We have an injured crew in that shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass?
Ward> I won't be pushed into this.
Alan> Aye, sir.
Ward> Incredible. It's like looking off into... infinity, sir.  Remember the course in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? Back to the time when men still believed the Earth was flat?
Martin> Fire.
Ward> If you don't, I'll relieve you of duty.
Alan> ... "or more?" I didn't know that.
Alan> Still, there is a chance. Captain, if we can time it exactly -- I think we can beam a team through the hole and onto the planet.
Martin> No, sir. He must have seen me use the com panel.
Martin> Admiral, Deanna... I need a moment with you...  ... Commander Data, if you will, please accompany the Ambassador on his... tour.
Martin> We just ran a full test of those systems.
Martin> How do they open the conduits?
Alan> Hello Guinan. Keeping this guy out of trouble?
Alan> We came here to help these people.
Alan> Security teams, stand by.
Ward> Thank you Mister Crusher. Make all preparations to get underway.
Alan> Well, now at least the waiting is over.
Martin> I didn't even catch that fish.
Martin> I think so. I have been preparing.
Martin> No, it's just the opposite. She knows what's in your mind and she lets you know what's on hers.
Ward> Bet is twenty-five to you, Lieutenant.
Alan> Riker here. The power transfer appears stable at this end, Captain.
Alan> Captain... it's time. We'd better go.
Alan> So, the other members of the Q continuum kicked you out.
Martin> Dimensions, Worf?
Alan> Never cared for it.
Alan> Let's greet our guest.
Martin> What do you recommend?
Ward> Maybe... maybe Doctor Crusher could treat you... bring you back... to the way you were before.
Alan> Go ahead.
Alan> I realize that, Data.  But I'd rather be facing a court martial than trying to live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths.  Commander Riker to Enterprise.
Martin> I think there's a lot to discuss. Can't we be reasonable here?
Ward> Probably a good idea.
Alan> Really?
Martin> Right.
Ward> Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Commander William Riker, your first officer. Those of you who are here as replacements will step outside and Lieutenant Lewis will assign you to crew quarters.  Ensign, you are here on the exchange program, you'll follow Mister Crusher.
Ward> I remember it now... I was in an alley... they attacked me from behind. I tried to defend myself with the nisroh knife Worf gave me...  I managed to fight off one of them... but I think they injected me with some kind of drug...
Alan> I'll bet you I can find a card that you bury anywhere in this deck. And furthermore, I'll make you help me do it.
Alan> You've also seen it in what I can do.
Alan> Rotate shield frequencies...  Data, report...
Martin> One thousand, fourteen.
Martin> Bridge to engineering. What's going on, Geordi?
Martin> Thank you, sir.
Martin> Data, this is Riker. What have you found?
Martin> I hope I'm better than you realize, Ral.
Alan> We found your DNA on the consoles, and on the bulkheads... we know you were there.
Martin> The last two, three nights...
Ward> Mister Data. We've got a very sick boy on the Enterprise who's not getting any better. And we're dead in the water until you get us out of here.
Alan> I know you're on vacation. You'll probably want to sleep late, and go to the holodeck. But if you'd like to help out, we could use an extra hand in preparing for the Phoenix Cluster survey.
Alan> I've always had the notion that if I was ever so injured that I couldn't make it on my own two feet... it would be over.
Alan> Doctor, I can't allow you to risk yourself like this.  Captain, this is Riker --
Alan> Who? You can't mean Doctor Noonien Soong?
Alan> I got out with the last of the colonists. If it hadn't been for the perimeter teams, we wouldn't have made it.
Ward> We don't consider even one survivor petty.
Alan> We really ought to see for ourselves.
Martin> Power... weapons... communications. We're being stripped one system at a time...
Alan> How long would it take to set it up?
Alan> No... just... strange sensations...
Alan> You do that very well. So what's the point?
Alan> You're dismissed, Mister Crusher.
Alan> This secret hiding place of yours... ?
Alan> How long will it take you?
Ward> Turn it over.
Martin> That's one option...
Martin> Why hasn't anybody noticed this before?
Alan> Thank you. Now the first thing I think we should discuss is this...
Alan> Heavy casualties in the secondary hull. Navigational sensor array inoperative.
Ward> Data -- how long to complete your scans? Let's not stay any longer than we have to.
Alan> Nobody knows the Transporters better than O'Brien and La Forge. They tell me they've managed more than a little sleight of hand with our authorization codes.
Ward> You look pretty good for someone who's been eating sickbay food for three days.
Martin> Have you ever heard anything like that, Data?
Ward> Tasha, take over. I'm going to Holdeck Three.
Ward> I'd be a fool not to know how lucky I am to be on this ship serving with this group of people. It's a dream come true.
Ward> Amanda...
Alan> Who is that?
Ward> You're so beautiful...
Martin> Do you? Really?  Imzadi... yes, you are my beloved. Today. But I can't lie to you and say I'm certain about tomorrow ... and tomorrow ... I can't guarantee it will be something you can share.  Because you are my Imzadi, I refuse to promise you a future I can't yet see.
Martin> Definitely.  Keep me informed.
Martin> They may be testing us. Seeing if we'll stick to the arrangements.
Ward> An emergency transponder?
Martin> To... sleep.
Ward> Come.
Martin> Gentlemen, how are you coming?  What the hell is that?
Alan> Worf, you two seal the chamber.
Martin> Yes.
Alan> More basic than that. What was he?
Ward> I will tell my captain to expect your grievance.
Martin> The Enterprise will be there, sir. Maybe a little late. But we'll be there.
Alan> Couldn't we just blow it into harmless chunks?
Ward> We lost Tasha on an away mission, under my command. The thought of the same thing happening to her sister...
Alan> Do you think it might have something to do with ego?
Alan> Counselor, what's this all about?
Alan> Doctor, we don't have more time. Once he was wired into the Borg, they knew everything he knew. I'm hoping it goes both ways. If we're lucky, he had access to everything we need to know about them... especially their vulnerabilities.
Alan> I don't care what he's been running. My patience just ran out.
Martin> Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems.
Martin> We'll start a pattern search from this point.
Ward> Can we do it?
Alan> Let's go!
Martin> I am going to have to leave you for a while and see to my duties.
Alan> I'd be happy to show you to your quarters --
Alan> You don't really think I'm going to help you.
Alan> Initiate prefire sequence.
Martin> Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.
Alan> Freighter Sanction... this is the Enterprise, get on the transporter pad and...  Forget it. Just lock on to any life forms you can find and get them over.
Martin> Is that what you want?
Alan> And I'm very much against it. Lutan is clearly a liar, and devious. Counselor Troi has admitted she believes him capable of killing. It is my duty to keep the captain out of danger, sir.
Alan> Seems their style.  Would you like to hear more?
Ward> The next time we saw you, you asked me to join the Q continuum.
Martin> And that's all?
Alan> I doubt they were there for the climate.
Martin> Switch now!
Alan> Data... ?
Ward> I understand, Captain. Would a "courteous" Yellow Alert apply at this time?
Ward> I've got this one!
Alan> Deanna? Lwaxana?
Martin> Let's hope that's enough.
Martin> It's good to be back. Is everyone recovering?
Martin> Look... if we're going to get out of here, you've got to trust me...
Ward> Energize.
Martin> No...
Martin> If I'm right, you're not really here... and this isn't a real phaser...  It's all a fantasy, and I'm ending it no matter what it takes...
Alan> Romulan disruptor fire...
Martin> Tell Lwaxana to keep him relaxed while we call the cavalry...
Martin> My problem, Commander, is I expect to be notified before there's a change in my orders...
Ward> I knew another one of the Rossas who was killed in action at the Krasner outpost...
Alan> I'll take it in the Ready Room.  A secure channel, Geordi.
Ward> Something wrong, Doctor?
Martin> Engines?
Martin> When you've worked it out, you'll understand command.
Alan> You bet. Dying is bad enough -- but losing my sense of humor? Forget it.
Martin> Bridge to engineering.
Ward> Give me everything you've got.
Martin> That sounds like the next logical step... we should start with the most crucial area first...
Martin> Check out the primary EPS coupling, see if you can get some power to the rest of these consoles.
Ward> What battle? When? Which unit, which sector?
Ward> Does this ionization pose a threat to Mister Barclay?
Alan> That's not the captain I know...
Alan> Data, you know how much I value your judgment. But I can't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your "belief".  Doctor... prepare the exocomps.
Ward> Very well. I have the Bridge.
Ward> With all the power that MacDuff had... to alter our brain chemistry, and manipulate the computers... it's hard to believe he needed the Enterprise.
Alan> Guinan?! I don't believe you've ever called the bridge before.
Ward> Engines?
Alan> Which could start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war. And we still might not be able to save the captain.
Martin> Patched is good enough.
Alan> That's... an understatement... I can't even...
Ward> I find them very much as we were a few hundred years ago... but with the technology we have now. They're very dangerous...
Martin> I'll talk to him.
Alan> Nice to meet you, Pinocchio.
Martin> And if the Ferengi also realize the forcefield emanates from the planet, sir?
Martin> Wait, Beverly. How is it moving, Data?
Ward> I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.
Alan> They've broken through a security field, deck ten, section two...
Martin> Sounds like that would take a lot of warp energy...
Martin> You are not real!
Alan> Pair of threes.
Ward> Yes, sir.
Martin> Then you think I'm not sincere?
Ward> Aye, sir.
Martin> I know you were all disappointed with my last culinary effort.
Ward> Damn it.
Alan> Then you're inviting me in?
Alan> You look strange, Paul...
Martin> Now that troubles me. Do you consider yourself superior to us?
Alan> Deanna, Lwaxana. Anything I can do for you?
Ward> No, sir. He must have seen me use the com panel.
Alan> Starbase one-seven-nine, this is the USS Enterprise.
Alan> Surely you don't want to remain here. How will you take care of yourselves?
Martin> Transporter Room. One to beam to the bridge.
Alan> On screen.
Martin> On screen.
Alan> A Klingon delicacy. That's heart of targ -- this is pipius claw. And this is stewed "gagh."
Ward> Any recommendations?
Martin> I checked into her record, too.  Her last posting was on Deriben Five. I spoke with her commanding officer there. He said she's argumentative... quick to take offense. He told me that he transferred Uhnari to this relay station because she was hampering their efforts.  To be honest, sir... I'm beginning to have doubts about her story.
Alan> Captain, there is sufficient evidence. Outposts have been destroyed... Countless lives have been lost.
Ward> Captain... with your permission, I've decided to remain on the Enterprise.
Alan> You were a logistics officer assigned to sector eight-one-five...
Martin> Mister Worf, contact the Hood and inform them of our delay.
Martin> But the three percent efficiency increase of the other vessels could still have been caused by other things such as simply working more carefully, better station coordination...
Martin> But I'm still not confident about that final speech...
Martin> Come on.
Ward> I realize it will be disturbing, Governor... but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that I am Odan... I have his thoughts, his memories, his skills...
Alan> He could be dying by inches...
Ward> We have a guest accommodation at your disposal, sir.
Ward> Just deal. I'd like to get some of my losings back before the next century.
Martin> We found a type two phaser in your shuttlecraft. It was taken from the weapons locker on the station.
Alan> What negotiations? What treaty?
Ward> Can I get you another?
Alan> We want to talk --
Ward> Captain... my duty as First Officer is to safeguard the lives on this ship. Including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you, sir. Not in this situation.
Alan> They don't want to take on the Enterprise...
Alan> How current is your information, Data?
Martin> Data, if you've got a theory on what's happening...
Alan> Doctor, contact Dulisian Four... and confirm that distress call. I have a feeling it may prove to be a false alarm.
Ward> No, but for Data's sake it has to be said. I've been forced into this, and I have only one option. To give this my best effort.
Ward> How about plain old basic sex? You must have some need for that.
Ward> The wave is gaining on us, we need more speed.
Martin> I'm not sure anyone can.
Alan> Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks.
Alan> Can't they go to local authorities?
Ward> This novel... and everyone in it you've just described... that's this hotel...
Alan> You don't know what it is?
Alan> Great!
Ward> Frozen. How many?
Ward> Okay. Stand by to transport to the Enterprise.
Alan> What's that?
Martin> It didn't spare everyone, Doctor.
Alan> An entire planet obliterated... except for a few acres of trees and grass... and one building?
Alan> She knows her stuff, Captain.
Ward> What kind of damage would we have to do to shut them down... ?
Ward> Mister Data, will you explain?
Alan> What do you mean, Doctor?
Martin> Yes, sir...
Alan> Data, what ship is carrying the envoy?
Alan> How can he leave?
Martin> Of us. Of what we could become...
Ward> Anybody?!
Martin> Option one is starting to sound better...
Alan> In time for what... ?
Ward> Generated by what?
Alan> They're in stasis...  Medical team to the Bridge.
Martin> You know Muktok plants live for hundreds of years...
Alan> Computer, identify the occupant in the detention cell.
Ward> But it's our boy -- roughly five times our mass and carrying enough armament to pulverize a planet.
Ward> I doubt she'll have time for you, my friend. She's slated to rule an entire world.
Martin> La Forge, boost the confinement beam!
Ward> A cloaking device, perhaps... something to hide the whole base...
Alan> The sooner the better...
Martin> I heard you, Lieutenant. And I rejected your plan.
Ward> That phaser's set to kill, Captain.
Alan> Worf -- nobody has suggested removing the captain from command.
Alan> Why?
Ward> Transporter Room, this is Commander Riker. Beam up four at my coordinates.
Martin> We're going in amidships protected by an isolation forcefield. We'll take one quick look. Fifteen seconds. If we don't like what we see, we beam back immediately.
Martin> It is an awkward situation for her. As you can imagine.
Ward> Time?
Alan> Run the simulation.
Martin> Problem, Mister Worf?
Ward> I checked into her record, too.  Her last posting was on Deriben Five. I spoke with her commanding officer there. He said she's argumentative... quick to take offense. He told me that he transferred Uhnari to this relay station because she was hampering their efforts.  To be honest, sir... I'm beginning to have doubts about her story.
Ward> Worf isn't dying and he's not in pain... he can live a long life without---
Martin> No, I'm not an alien...
Ward> I've always had the notion that if I was ever so injured that I couldn't make it on my own two feet... it would be over.
Martin> The polar region... But that's starting from scratch, Data. The last reading we had on the Essex would suggest we begin the scans near our crash site...
Alan> You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attache?
Ward> Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you?
Martin> Why wouldn't he send a Klingon ship?
Alan> How long before they're fully conscious?
Martin> They certainly are... fit, right?
Alan> But their influence on history has ended, sir. That ship disappeared from the past twenty-two years ago and never returned.
Martin> Red Alert.
Martin> What kind of signal?
Martin> I'll need access to your logs, your files...  It won't take long. My people can do the work.
Alan> That's it, isn't it... we're on equal footing now...
Ward> Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
Alan> If we know it -- so do the Tamarians.  Riker to La Forge.
Alan> That's why we gave you the job.  Let me know as soon as you're set.
Martin> My girl.
Ward> They were all in an open locker. I don't think he was too concerned with security.
Ward> He said he'd never heard of me... that they had no officer matching my description...
Alan> This is too easy.
Martin> Under the circumstances -- I think you may be right.
Martin> I agree. We're at war.
Martin> Well... most people think so. But that's the kind of question that might take an hour or two to answer.
Ward> I agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do, but the risk is too great.
Alan> It's complete, but I would like to request an addition.
Alan> Why?
Martin> Something's wrong. Data, you have the Bridge.  Security, meet me on deck seven, section twenty-five baker.
Alan> Well, it's a Federation shuttle all right.
Martin> I don't envy your abilities.
Martin> Then let us talk to men from the Odin one last time. Let me try to convince them to leave with us.
Alan> Meaning?
Alan> You didn't have to kill him.
Alan> When it comes to this ship, to this crew, you're damned right I'll play it safe.
Martin> How many cards are left?
Alan> It was like he was... blaming me or something. But it's more than just this one incident. For the past few days, I've been feeling like everyone's staring at me... or talking about me...
Ward> It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Martin> And Data left a trace imprint when he beamed down?
Alan> Yes, sir.
Martin> But it won't accomplish anything. There's no way they can save Narendra Three...
Alan> If this keeps up, that thing will tear the Enterprise apart!
Alan> I don't want your command.
Ward> That's interesting.
Alan> It'll be night at the site in thirty minutes. We've scheduled an away team for dawn.
Martin> Computer, transfer command to engineering... Full security alert!
Alan> Then I recommend you do not fire until you are within forty thousand kilometers.
Alan> Everything you say is true.
Alan> Hold where you are Klag. I have relieved Captain Kargan. He was acting in an irrational manner. I am now your captain!!  Serve this ship as I have!
Alan> Let's make it look good. Ensign, release the inertial dampers.
Alan> You, an expert on humanity... ?
Martin> Data.
Martin> The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory.
Alan> The Federation Starship Enterprise.  Chief, call security. We need an escort for this man.
Ward> ... and with a sudden, abrupt power surge to high warp speed, Captain, I believe we can break loose from the Ferengi forcefield.
Alan> Enterprise, this is Captain William Riker of the Klingon vessel, the Pagh.  I order you to lower your shields and surrender.
Alan> Data, this is Riker. What have you found?
Martin> Good luck, Doctor.
Ward> The image of Rice has been replaced by something which is hovering several meters away.
Martin> I'm afraid that's not possible. Last night, Jono attacked Captain Picard and tried to murder him. We are holding him in custody.
Alan> Sounds like there aren't that many differences between your species and mine...
Martin> Doctor...
Ward> I'll agree with Worf at this point, sir. Let's be careful.
Ward> The rematerialization subroutine has been disabled.
Alan> Data... I need a projection of the radiation impact on the crew... Worf...  ... signal the mining settlement. Tell them -- we won't be joining the search for awhile.
Ward> Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course.  This one's getting away...
Martin> Reduce life support to minimum requirements, Mister Data.
Alan> How long before the hull ruptures?
Alan> One of the specimens is growing.
Ward> This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything.
Ward> Mister Data and our guest appear to be tardy...
Ward> Magnify.
Ward> Usually none. But it's been fitted with two type-four phaser emitters... we'll use them to chart the null space.
Ward> That being the case -- permission to leave the bridge.
Ward> Well, you might be right. Still, I'd like to give the crash site a once-over first... We'll maintain our present orbit for now.
Alan> Even with a treaty, they're skittish about protecting their borders.
Ward> Worf, what the hell do the sensors show... ?
Martin> That may be dangerous.
Ward> This meeting isn't for you, Wesley!
Ward> Me?
Alan> If you can't stabilize life-support, we'll have to evacuate the ship.
Alan> Mister Data.  Think about it Mister Potts. And while you're at it, think about what might have happened had we not been this close to a starbase medical facility.
Martin> Then why are you all so excited?
Ward> No.  Get ready to deploy the mines.
Martin> You think we'll need to put in to a starbase?
Alan> Deanna... I don't know if you can hear me.  I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them... that it might even help stimulate the brain and speed the healing...  In fact, I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape...
Alan> An incoming message -- Code Forty Seven, sir.
Martin> Open the channel, Mister Worf, and prepare to fire at target one.
Ward> I know...
Ward> Not bothering to cloak themselves.
Martin> But this won't be boring. If "Q"'s anything, he's imaginative.  Apparently the captain wasn't meant to be with us here.
Alan> What woman would have him? With an ego like his --
Ward> But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey.
Martin> What's the source of the probe?
Alan> Will it be good enough?
Ward> That's a little too selective for coincidence.
Alan> The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out. Data's coordinating the salvage effort right now.  Sir.
Ward> Damage...
Martin> Coordinates?
Alan> No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not going to play anymore.
Alan> How's it going?
Alan> Radue, exactly why have we been invited to Aldea?
Martin> And so many on both sides died in that war. How could you and I be here now... like this... if we were unable to let go of the anger, the blame.  When does it end, Worf? If the Romulan dies, does his family carry the bitterness forward another generation?
Alan> Storm front going to affect the transport, Chief... ?
Ward> And bring it to the bridge. Immediately!
Martin> Of course.
Martin> None that I'd want to share with an audience.
Alan> Where am I?  How did you get me off the ship?
Martin> Maximum shields. Take us out of orbit, Ensign. Mister Worf, prepare to return fire...
Ward> I'm sorry. There's nothing else we can do.
Ward> What's this?
Alan> No. He's a friend of Doctor Crusher's.
Ward> Then there should be... computer, discontinue program and erase...
Alan> I agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do, but the risk is too great.
